Ui:
Sis, come on. You'd better get out of bed. Sis?

Yui:
Ah! I-it's eight! I'm late! Oh!

Ui:
Hey, why the rush? Hm?

Yui:
See you later!

Lady:
Oh, good morning, Yui.

Yui:
Good morning!

Yui:
What?! I read the clock wrong!
Starting today, I'm a high schooler!

Opening Song
Cagayake!GIRLS by 放課後ティータイム(After School Tea Time)

Girls:
Congratulations on starting school here!

Girl 1:
Please join the Tennis Club!

Girl 2:
The Judo Club's better!

Girl 3:
Please join the Tea Ceremony Club!

Girl 4:
Please join the Abacus Club!

Girls:
Please, please!

Yui:
Uh...
Hm... Hmm? Hm...

Yui:
Hmmm...

Nodoka:
What are you groaning about, Yui?

Yui:
Hm? Oh, hello, Nodoka. I'm not sure which club I should join in--

Nodoka:
What?! You haven't decided on one? It's already been two weeks since school started! You have to choose!

Yui:
But I'm absolutely terrible at every sport, and I don't really get any of the literary clubs.

Nodoka:
This is how people end up becoming NEETs.

Yui:
You're pegged as a NEET just because you don't join a club?

Nodoka:
You know, looking back on it, for as long as I've known you, you've never joined a single club, have you?

Yui:
Crud! I really do feel like I ought to at least try to do something. But what the heck should I be doing?

Ritsu:
Mio!

Mio:
Ritsu?

Ritsu:
Let's go check out the club!

Mio:
Which club do you mean?

Ritsu:
The Light Music Club, what do ya' think?

Mio:
But I was planning on joining the Literature Club.

Ritsu:
Ah!?

Mio:
I've already filled out the application form.

Ritsu:
Hmm... Rip.

Mio:
Ah! What do you think you're doing?

Ritsu:
C'mon, let's go! Move it, move it!

Mio:
Cut it out!

Ritsu:
Huh? It's been disbanded?!

Sawako:
Well, on the verge of being disbanded. All the students who were in the club last year have now graduated, so the club will be disbanded unless four students join this month.

Ritsu:
Oh, so that's why there wasn't anyone in the Music Room.

Yui:
Ms. Yamanaka!

Sawako:
Hi, Yui. I'll be right there.
I'm sorry, I have a music class to teach in a few minutes. Light Music Club, good luck.

Mio:
She sure was pretty, wasn't she?

Ritsu:
That is not the issue here.

Yui:
Uh...

Ritsu & Mio:
Oh.

Sawako:
Please hand out these syllabus sheets to all the students.
Syllabus sheets?

Yui:
Oh, right! So sorry about that!
Hm? They're staring at me!

Ritsu:
Bad tempo.

Yui:
Oh, no!

Ritsu:
She's useless.

Yui:
I-I'm so sorry!

Sawako:
Are you all right?

Ritsu:
And clumsy.

Mio:
It's being disbanded, so that's that. I'm gonna go join the Literature Club.

Ritsu:
If I join and there aren't any members, does that make me the club president? Ah! Doesn't sound bad at all!

Yui:
Um. what was that club you were talking about with those girls?

Sawako:
The Light Music Club?

Yui:
Yeah, what is it?

Sawako:
The Light Music Club is about playing light-hearted music.

Yui:
Light... Music Club?

Sawako:
That's right. The Light Music Club.

Mio:
So, what's your plan, Ritsu?

Ritsu:
We wait for prospective members!

Mio:
We just wait?

Ritsu:
Wait!

Mio:
Come on, let's go home.

Tsumugi:
Hello? I wanted to find out about joining your club.

Ritsu:
Ah! The Light Music Club?

Tsumugi:
No, I meant the Choir Club.

Ritsu:
But why not join the Light Music Club instead?

Tsumugi:
But... the Choir Club--

Ritsu:
We need more members like you!

Tsumugi:
Oh...

Ritsu:
Please! I'm begging you! You won't regret it, I promise!

Mio:
Don't try to force her to join like that! It's really rude! I'm going now. I'm sorry.

Ritsu:
Mio! What about that promise we made? Was that just a big lie?! That I would play drums, and that you would play the bass! Our band! We've been saying forever that we would start one! Huh? We promised each other, remember?! That night we went to see that concert together!

Mio:
--This is it.

Ritsu:
--This is, isn't it?

Ritsu:
Were those sweet words nothing but a big lie?!

Mio:
No, your flashback is.

Ritsu:
Oh, really it is?

Ritsu:
--Mio, this is it! You and I are going to play in a band together! Isn't that exciting!

Mio:
You forced the idea on me.

Ritsu:
Yeah, but you said you wanted to!

Mio:
Yes, I did, but...

Ritsu:
And if we went pro, we said we'd split all the proceeds 70/30!

Mio:
Don't make stuff up.
Huh?

Mio & Ritsu:
Uh... Eh...

Tsumugi:
This will be a great deal of fun. The only instrument I can play is the keyboard. but I'd like to join your club if you will have me.

Ritsu:
Ah! Thank you so much! Now we only need one more person to join us!

Mio:
Well, I suppose that means I'm already a member.

Ritsu:
Um, you're...

Tsumugi:
Tsumugi Kotobuki.

Ritsu:
I'm Ritsu Tainaka, drums. This is Mio Akiyama, she's on bass. Let's see... Now we need a guitar player!

Nodoka:
Yui?

Yui:
My high school years are very important. I wanna do something...

Nodoka:
Well, then do it.

Yui:
Ugh... But I have absolutely no idea what it is I should do!

Nodoka:
Oh, good grief...

Burger shop's clerk:
Would you like any french fries with that, Miss?

Tsumugi:
Ah, yes! I would love some, thank you!

Burger shop's clerk:
Thank you.

Ritsu:
What is it?

Tsumugi:
This is my first time eating in a fast food restaurant!

Ritsu:
How can that be?

Tsumugi:
I know it's silly, but I've always dreamed of having someone ask me if I wanted french fries.

Ritsu:
Huh?

Tsumugi:
Oh, I'm sorry. Please begin the meeting.

Ritsu:
Oh. 'Kay, this meeting's come to order! Our goal is to recruit one more member by the end of the month!

Tsumugi:
How in the world do we do that?

Ritsu:
That's why we're meeting to think of a way right now! For instance, offering people an amazing prize if they decide to join!

Mio:
Amazing prize?

Ritsu:
Yeah! Like some kind of gift or something.

Tsumugi:
Like a car, or a plane, or a boat?

Mio:
Amazing but impractical.

Ritsu:
More along the lines of ice cream or help with homework.

Mio:
Who would join up for something like that?

Tsumugi:
What should we do, then?

Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Hmm...

Ritsu:
Nyororin...

Mio:
The president shouldn't lose interest!

Ritsu:
Come up with something to keep me interested.

Mio:
Uh, I want to go home.

Tsumugi:
Um, for now, why don't we...

Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
One, two!

Ritsu:
There's... There's just one more week remaining in April.

Tsumugi:
No one has answered our ads yet.

Mio:
Disbanded before we are a band.

Ritsu:
I won't let that happen!

Yui:
Ah! Huh? Hm... Wait, Light Music, huh?

Yui:
--Here I click, clack, click, clack. here I click...

Teacher:
--You're very good at that, Yui.

Yui:
I'm gonna do it!

Part B
Yui:
For the time being, I've decided to join the Light Music Club!

Nodoka:
Oh, yeah? So what is it that they do at this club?

Yui:
Dunno.

Nodoka:
Huh?

Yui:
But since the name of the club is "Light Music", I figured they only do really easy stuff. You know, like whistling.

Nodoka:
Sounds like they don't have much ambition.
You see? It looks like they're some kind of band.

Yui:
What? But I don't know how to play the guitar!

Nodoka:
Well then, what can you play?

Yui:
Umm... Umm... I can play castanets.
Click, clack, click...

Nodoka:
That's a perfect fit for you.

Ritsu:
See? Look at this here...

Sawako:
Good afternoon.

Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Good afternoon!

Sawako:
A prospective member has come forward.

Ritsu:
Oh!

Sawako:
Here. Isn't that wonderful news? Also, that's a lovely tea set, but make sure you clean up after yourselves once you're done, all right?

Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
All right!

Ritsu:
Yes! Now we won't be disbanded!

Mio:
Yui Hirasawa...

Ritsu:
Just her name makes her sound really awesome!

Mio:
She's got to be a guitarist.

Tsumugi:
I can't wait to meet her.

Ritsu:
Yeah! A real powerhouse has joined us!

Yui:
Light Music Club... Light Music Club...
I-if I don't get down this hallway, I won't reach the Light Music Club!

Sawako:
Oh, hello.

Sawako:
--The Light Music Club is up in the Music Room.

Yui:
This is the place? It won't be an easy thing to say right after joining, but I've got to quit. I wonder what kind of people would join the Light Music Club?

Krauser II:
Oh, you want to quit, do you? Did you think you could walk away without any consequences?! I'll murder you!

Yui:
What am I gonna do?!
Wah!
You've got it all wrong! You've got it all wrong!

Ritsu:
Hmm... Huh? It's the useless, clumsy bad tempo girl!
What is it you're doing?

Yui:
You startled me.

Ritsu:
Uh... You aren't Yui Hirasawa by any chance?

Yui:
Y-yes!

Ritsu:
The girl who wants to join us?

Yui:
Y-yes!

Ritsu:
Aah! I'm so sorry I misjudged you! I'm sure you must be totally awesome on guitar! We've all been waiting for you to get here!

Yui:
It seems like someone's been embellishing things about me...

Ritsu:
Hey, guys! Our brand new member has arrived!

Mio:
Is that her?

Tsumugi:
Aha!

Mio:
Welcome to the Light Music Club!

Tsumugi:
It's so good to have you here!

Ritsu:
Right! Mugi, go get the tea ready!

Tsumugi:
Okay!

Yui:
Wh-what should I do?

Tsumugi:
Go ahead, it's quite delicious!

Yui:
Wow, this is great! This is so good! Mmm...
Maybe I should give up on trying to quit...

Ritsu:
What kind music do you like to play?

Yui:
Huh?

Ritsu:
Who's your all time favorite band?

Yui:
Uh...

Ritsu:
Which guitarists do you like?

Yui:
Uh...
Oh my, I have to tell them. I can't really play the guitar at all!
Je-je-je...

Mio:
Oh, are you trying to say Jimi Hendrix?!

Ritsu:
Whoa!

Yui:
No, it's not. I mean, I don't...

Mio:
Jimmy Page, then?!

Ritsu:
Oh!

Yui:
No! No, I je-je-

Mio:
Jeff Beck?!

Yui:
Are there really this many guitarists whose names start with "J"?!

Ritsu:
Oh, wow, Jeff Beck, that's cool!

Tsumugi:
Who is he?

Mio:
In the music world, they say that there's only two kind of rock guitarists: Jeff Beck, and everyone else. He's a brilliant and challenging guitarist who's always searching for new sounds.

Tsumugi:
My goodness!

Ritsu:
You're so hardcore, Miss Hirasawa! I gotta say I'm so glad that someone like her joined the club!

Tsumugi:
We were at the point where the club would have been disbanded if we hadn't gotten another member within the next week.

Ritsu:
Thank you so much for joining!

Yui:
They keep making it harder! But I'm... I'm just going to have to spit it out!
Um, I'm really sorry, I don't know how to say it, but I made a mistake joining this club, and I only came here to beg you to let me quit!

Ritsu:
Wha...?

Yui:
I can't play the guitar. I thought you would be playing a different kind of instrument.

Tsumugi:
What instrument can you play, then?

Yui:
Casta-- Er, the harmonica.

Ritsu:
Oh, I have a harmonica right here. Try playing somethin'!

Yui:
Ah! I'm sorry, I can't play it!

Mio:
But, Miss Hirasawa, if you wanted to join this club, that means that you're at least interested in music, right?

Tsumugi:
Is there another club you'd rather join?

Yui:
Uh, no, none in particular.

Ritsu:
We can't let this mark leave this room, no matter what!

Mio:
To keep the club from being disbanded...

Tsumugi:
We have to keep her here somehow!

Yui:
I'm sorry. I really mean it. Bye.

Ritsu:
Wait just a minute!

Tsumugi:
How about another cup of tea?

Yui:
But I--

Tsumugi:
We have cookies and madeleines, as well.

Ritsu:
Mm-hmm!

Mio:
They're baiting the hook!

Yui:
So good! I-I'm sorry, I didn't mean to come here and gorge myself.

Ritsu:
Hey, don't sweat it!

Tsumugi:
I think we should start eating snacks like this every day from now on.

Mio:
Aren't we drifting off topic here-- Ow!

Ritsu:
Miss Hirasawa, what other sorts of things do you like?

Yui:
Uh... Oh, I like anything that tastes good.

Ritsu:
Geez, just food?
Mhm. On your days off, do you spend your time at home doing anything in particular?

Yui:
Just sitting around, I guess.

Tsumugi:
What kind of things do you like?

Yui:
Um, I like cute things, I guess.

Mio:
Have any weaknesses?

Yui:
I'm not very good with extreme heat or cold. I spend winter under the table where it's warm and in the summer, I spend my time on the floor where it's cool.

Mio:
She's a tough one.

Ritsu:
What the heck do we do?

Tsumugi:
I don't know.

Yui:
Um, I should go.

Ritsu:
Please, don't go, I'm begging you! You can just hang out and do nothing if you want!

Tsumugi:
I'll try to bring even tastier snacks, okay?

Yui:
I'm really sorry. I didn't take things seriously when I applied to join. I got all your hopes up. How can I ever apologize?

Tsumugi:
We're the ones who should apologize.

Mio:
We shouldn't have tried to force you to stay.

Ritsu:
So please! At least hang around for a while and listen to us play a song!

Yui:
Oh! You'll play a song for me?!

Ritsu:
She's swallowed the bait!

Yui:
Oh...

Mio:
Hm.

Ritsu:
Hm.

Tsumugi:
Mm.

Ritsu:
One, two, three, four!

Ritsu:
What did you think?

Yui:
I don't know what to say... It's really hard to put into words!

Ritsu:
Mm-hmm.

Yui:
You guys aren't very good, are you?

Ritsu:
Talk about blunt!

Yui:
But it seems like it would be a whole lot of fun to do! I decided that I'm going to join this club!

Ritsu:
Uh...

Mio:
Eh...

Ritsu:
Banzai!
Excuse me. Okay, let's commemorate the start of the Light Music Club!

Mio:
Hey, that's my camera!

Ritsu:
Here we go, guys!

Yui:
But the problem is that I can't play any instruments at all. Can I be a manager or something?

Ritsu:
Well, we aren't a sports club.
{{Jp|いやあ、運動部じゃあないんだし。}

Tsumugi:
I know! Why don't you take this opportunity to begin learning the guitar?

Yui:
But it looks very complicated! I don't think I could.

Ritsu:
Don't worry about it! Between the three of us, we'll teach you everything you need to know.

Yui:
Um... I guess you're right. Listening to you play just now made me feel like I could do at least that well, if not a lot better!

Ritsu:
So glad we could help.

Nodoka:
What?! You went ahead and joined anyway?

Yui:
Mm-hmm. They practically begged me to join!

Nodoka:
Seriously?! Oh, as a manager or something, right?

Yui:
When someone else says it, it sounds insulting. I joined as a full-fledged member of the band! And they say they'll teach me to play guitar!

Nodoka:
Huh... Oh, that means you're gonna have to go out and buy yourself a new guitar.

Yui:
Hmm... I wonder if they'll let me borrow one?

Nodoka:
Probably not.

Yui:
Uh... You can buy them for about fifty dollars, right?

Nodoka:
Oh, boy. I wonder if the Light Music Club knows what they're getting themselves into with this girl.

Yui:
Hey, everyone! These three are my fellow Light Music Club members.

Tsumugi:
I wanted to pick a club where I could make friends with the sort of fun, pleasant people that one so rarely meets.

Mio:
Y-Yui?

Ritsu:
All right! Let's get to it! Go!

Yui:
Hm? Oh. Hey, guys! Ow!
But now that I finally made it to high school, I've joined a club for the first time!
Nodoka:
Yui.

Yui:
Oh! Hi, Nodoka!

Nodoka:
Wanna walk home with me?

Yui:
Oh, no, I'm sorry, Nodoka. There's a club meeting I have to go to today.

Nodoka:
Oh, really? I guess I'll have to walk by myself.
She's finally found something she can get into. I'm happy and sad at the same time.

Yui:
Hehehe...

Nodoka:
What's wrong, Yui?

Yui:
Mugi-chan said she's gonna bring some tasty snacks today!

Nodoka:
You're not going to play guitar?

Yui:
Hm? Hee, hee.
It was like this even in kindergarten. And grade school, too. Even when we got into middle school.

Nodoka:
--Your ice cream.

Yui:
My life has always been kinda unfocused. But now that I finally made it to high school, I've joined a club for the first time!

Opening Song
Cagayake!GIRLS by 放課後ティータイム(After School Tea Time)

Yui:
Hey, everyone!
These three are my fellow Light Music Club members.

Mio:
Hello.

Yui:
This is Mio Akiyama, our bassist. She's tall and pretty, and gives off a real "cool grown woman" vibe.
Hey, Mio, how come you decided to take up playing bass instead of a regular guitar?

Mio:
Hmm... Playing guitar is... well, embarrassing.

Yui:
Embarrassing?

Mio:
You know, the guitar is the core instrument of the band, and because of that, you have to play right up in front of the group. So the eyes of everyone in the audience are on you. Just thinking about being in a position like that makes me... Oh!

Yui:
Mio!
Mio is kinda delicate.

Tsumugi:
Mio, are you all right?

Yui:
This is our keyboardist, Tsumugi Kotobuki. We call her "Mugi" for short.
She's calm, soothing, and really, really nice.
You know, you're a terrific keyboard player, Mugi. I'll bet you've been playing for a long time.

Tsumugi:
I started studying the piano when I was only four years old. I've been managed to win a few awards at some competitions.

Yui:
Oh, wow! That's amazing!
Why did she join the Light Music Club?

Tsumugi:
All right, dig in, everyone!

Yui:
Oh, I almost forgot, I've been meaning to ask you something. This club room is really nice and very well equipped. Are all of the high schools in the area like this nowadays?

Tsumugi:
Oh, no. I brought all that stuff from my house.

Yui:
It's yours?!

Tsumugi:
Yes.

Yui:
Mugi is definitely one of those "rich girl" types.
Our drummer's name is Ritsu Tainaka. She's a cheerful girl who's just full of energy.
You really seem like someone who would be a drummer.

Ritsu:
What?! I've got a completely legitimate reason for that! A powerful reason that moves almost everyone who hears it!

Yui:
What?! Tell me, tell me, come on!

Ritsu:
It's because...

Yui:
Hmm?

Ritsu:
Well, you know it's... 'Cause they're cool.

Yui:
That's it?

Ritsu:
Ugh! Oh, come on! Just imagining having to wriggle my fingers like crazy just to play a guitar, bass, or keyboard makes me wanna scream! I really hate it!

Yui:
Wow, I guess your choice of instruments reflects your personality.

Tsumugi:
Would you like another one?

Yui:
Yes, thank you! So you first wanted to join the Choir Club, but joined ours instead?

Tsumugi:
That's right. You see, I wanted to pick a club where I could make friends with the sort of fun, pleasant people that one so rarely meets.

Mio & Ritsu:
We're like rare animals to her?

Mio:
That reminds me, Miss Hirasawa, have you bought your guitar yet?

Yui:
Just call me Yui. After all, I already call you by your first name, right, Mio?

Mio:
Y-Yui?

Yui:
Oh... That's so cute!

Ritsu:
So what about your guitar, Yui?

Yui:
Huh? Guitar? Oh, yeah, that's right! I forgot! I'm supposed to play guitar, aren't I?

Mio:
Yeah, well, this is the Light Music Club.

Yui:
Hehehe... Do you know how much a guitar's going to cost? A lot?

Mio:
Hmm... Well, the cheap ones start way down in the low hundreds, but believe me, you really don't want one that's too cheap. Something around 500 should be fine.

Yui:
Whoa, that much?! $500 is ten months' allowance.

Mio:
Yeah, well, expensive guitars can run up into the thousands.

Yui:
Can I use club funds?

Ritsu:
Nothing doing!

Yui:
Uh...

Tsumugi:
Here, try one, they're delicious.

Yui:
Mmm... Ah!

Mio:
Anyway, we can't really do anything if you don't have an instrument.

Ritsu:
Right, then! Let's go check out guitars on our next day off! Go!

Yui:
'Tis vexing...
Yes?

Ui:
Hey, come on, Sis, dinner's ready.

Yui:
Ui...

Ui:
What's wrong, Big Sis?

Yui:
I joined the Light Music Club.

Ui:
Really?!

Yui:
So, I want to buy a guitar I can use.

Ui:
Wow, I didn't even know you could play the guitar!

Yui:
I can't! So anyway, you think maybe you could lend me some money? I'll pay you back.

Ui:
I'm sorry, but I don't have a whole lot of money either.

Yui:
Yeah, I figured...

Ui:
Hey, why don't you just ask Mom for an advance on your allowance?

Yui:
Huh?

Ui:
I'll even go with you if you want me to, to back you up.

Yui:
Little Sis. I can always count on you!

Ui:
Hehehe...

Ritsu:
Oh, Yui! Hey! Over here! Over here!

Yui:
Hm? Oh! Hey, guys!
Ugh! Ow! Sorry!
Huh? Hehe...

Mio:
She's got like ten feet left.

Ritsu:
She can't make it the rest of the way?

Yui:
Who's a good boy? Who's a good doggie?

Tsumugi:
Did the money situation work out?

Yui:
I begged my mom and I got her to give me a $500 advance on my allowance. I have to be real careful with my spending from now on... And make sure I don't waste money... I can buy this now!

Ritsu:
Oh, come on, Yui!

Yui:
Oh, I'm just looking!

Yui:
Boy, I'm exhausted.

Ritsu:
I stocked up!

Tsumugi:
Wow, this was a lot of fun, wasn't it?

Yui:
So where do you guys want to go next? Wait a sec... Are we forgetting something?

Mio:
Your instrument, dummy!

Yui:
Whoa! Jeez, I forgot!

Yui:
Oh, wow! Look at all the guitars!
Oh... Huh? Hmm?

Monster:
Hey, hey!

Ritsu:
Yui! See anything that you like?

Yui:
Huh? Hmm... Are there guidelines or something to choose by?

Mio:
Of course there are. There's the tone of the guitar, of course, but there's also its weight, composition, and the shape and thickness of the neck. So for girls, one with a slender neck would be...

Yui:
Ah! This guitar here is cute!

Mio:
She never listens...

Ritsu:
That guitar costs $2,500.

Yui:
Huh? Wow, it does. Oh, but that's way, way more than I can afford.

Tsumugi:
Do you have your heart set on this one?

Yui:
Uh-huh.

Tsumugi:
Oh...

Ritsu:
Uh, there's some cheap ones over there.

Yui:
I really want this one, though...

Mio:
This reminds me how badly I wanted my current bass. I agonized over it.
--I'd like this one!

Ritsu:
And I haggled like crazy when I bought my used drum set.
--You can do better! No, try again!

Mio:
You made the salesman cry.

Ritsu:
Yeah, well, I wasn't leaving the store without those drums.

Yui:
Um, what is "haggling"?

Mio:
Hm?

Ritsu:
It's when you use grit and determination to force someone to lower the price on something you really want!

Tsumugi:
That is amazing! It's almost admirable!

Mio:
What's so admirable about it?
Uh... Yui...

Ritsu:
Ah! Got it! Let's all get a temp job!

Tsumugi:
Temp job?

Ritsu:
Um-hm! So we can help Yui buy her guitar!

Yui:
Huh?! No, I can't let you do that!

Ritsu:
Don't sweat it! This will be a club activity!

Yui:
Oh, Ritchan...

Tsumugi:
I'll try it! It could be fun!

Yui:
Mugi-chan?

Ritsu:
All right! Let's get to it! Go!

Tsumugi:
Go!

Ritsu:
Go!

Tsumugi:
Go!

Ritsu:
Go!

Mio:
What kind of job are we talking about?

Part B
Nodoka:
A job?

Yui:
Yes, so I can buy a guitar!

Nodoka:
When did she become so self-sufficient? I'm happy and sad at the same time.

Yui:
The rest of the Light Music Club has offered to help me get it.

Nodoka:
What? You've got the others involved?

Yui:
Yeah!

Yui:
So, what kind of job should we be looking for?

Ritsu:
We could hand out packs of tissues.

Mio:
--Uh... Mm... Uh... Uh...
I-I can't...

Ritsu:
What about a job in fast food?

Mio:
--Welcome, can I take your order?!
That's the problem.

Ritsu:
Oh, right. Might be kind of a tough hurdle for you, Mio.

Mio:
I couldn't push the button if I thought somebody scary would answer. I can't go and take orders! Oh!

Tsumugi:
Ah! Miss Mio!

Yui:
Oh, please, don't push yourself on my account!

Mio:
I keep telling myself I can't do it before I even try. This is so Yui can buy a guitar! So it's for the greater good of the Light Music Club! I have to overcome my limitations!
Name the job! I'll do anything!

Ritsu:
Oh!

Mio:
Wh-what? What is it?!

Ritsu:
How about this?

Everyone:
"Traffic Volume Survey"?

Ritsu:
We have to count the number of people and cars that pass by us. We do it using a counter.

Yui:
Like the Wild Bird Society!

Ritsu:
This is a job even Mio can do!

Tsumugi:
Yes, you're right!

Yui:
See you later!

Ui:
Wait, Sis! Don't forget your lunch!

Yui:
Whoa, why so much?

Ui:
I made lunch for everyone else in the Light Music Club, too. I mean, after all they took this job to help you, right?

Yui:
Yeah, thanks, Ui!

Ritsu:
Here. Now, we'll work in pairs and trade off every hour.

Yui:
Oh!

Tsumugi:
Goodness, you're very nimble.

Yui:
Oh, yeah!

Ritsu:
Oh, it looks like a challenge!

Yui:
Oh, you're really fast, Ritchan!

Ritsu:
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ow! Finger cramped!

Mio:
That happens when you get worked up.

Tsumugi:
You know, we have a bit of time before the survey starts. I think we should all have some tea.

Yui:
Yeah, let's go have a picnic!

Mio:
You guys really worry me sometimes.

Yui:
This weather sure feels nice today, doesn't it, Mugi?

Tsumugi:
Yes, it does.

Yui:
Ah... She's like a highlands princess!

Mio:
Huh? A magazine giveaway?

Ritsu:
One of the prizes is a guitar.

Mio:
That might just be the fastest way to get it, all right.

Ritsu:
Could be.

Yui:
Mugi, aren't you tired at all?

Tsumugi:
No, I feel fine.

Yui:
And your thumb doesn't hurt, either?

Tsumugi:
Uh-uh.

Yui:
You aren't sleepy?

Tsumugi:
Oh!

Yui:
Hm?

Tsumugi:
I just pressed the button on the counter instead of answering you!

Yui:
Hehe.

Mio:
She's playing a four beat.
And that's an eight beat.
Keep your mind on the job!

Yui:
Mugi, these sweets are really great and all, but is it okay for us to keep eating this fancy food all the time?

Tsumugi:
Oh, it's fine. All sorts of people give me these all the time. If I left them at home, it would only go to waste.

Yui:
People bring your family enough sweets to go to waste? What kind of family are you?!

Ritsu:
I'm counting the clouds.

Mio:
Is this an occupational sickness?

Ritsu:
That's a wrap for day one!

Tsumugi:
Well, I'll be out for the station, then.

Ritsu:
Mio and I are going by bus.

Mio:
You said that you're walking home, right, Yui?

Yui:
Mm-hm.

Tsumugi:
Tomorrow, let's...

Yui:
Yeah! Let's eat some more those great sweets!

Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Hm?

Tsumugi:
I was going to say, "Tomorrow, let's all work hard again."

Ritsu:
You better watch it!

Yui:
But if they'll just go to waste, then...

Ritsu:
Watch it. Watch it. Watch it. Watch it. Watch it. Watch it. Watch it.

Mio:
It is an occupational sickness...

Yui:
Bye! See ya!

Ritsu:
Sure!

Mio:
Bye!

Tsumugi:
See you tomorrow!

Yui:
Oh!
Hey, guys! Thanks for everything, I mean it! I promise, when I finally get my guitar, I'm gonna practice every day!

Woman:
Thank you for two days of hard work.

Everyone:
Ma'am, the pleasure was all ours!

Mio:
Here.

Ritsu:
So, $80 per day, huh?

Tsumugi:
Even with the $500 advance your mother gave you, that's still nowhere near enough.

Mio:
Guess we'll have to work a few more jobs, then.

Tsumugi:
You're right, Miss Mio.

Ritsu:
Okay, guess I'll hit the want ads again.

Mio:
Right.

Yui:
I just can't take this money from you. Please, I want you to spend the money that you earned on yourselves.

Tsumugi:
But, Yui?

Yui:
I'll buy myself a guitar all on my own.

Ritsu:
Yui...

Yui:
I want to get the guitar and start practicing right away so I can play with you guys. Would you mind going out to the music store with me again tomorrow?

Everyone:
Mm-hm.

Yui:
Thanks for everything, guys. I'd better go home now.

Mio:
See you tomorrow, Yui.

Tsumugi:
Goodbye.

Yui:
'Bye, guys.
I have to get good fast for me and for them.

Tsumugi:
Well, I'd best be heading home, too.

Ritsu & Mio:
Mm-hm.

Tsumugi:
Huh?

Ritsu:
Oh, man, I think Yui's losing it.

Yui:
Oh! Eh-heh...

Mio:
She really wants that badly.

Ritsu:
Okay, then let's get another job!

Tsumugi:
Oh... Wait right here, okay?

Tsumugi:
Hi, excuse me.

Staff:
Yes?

Tsumugi:
Would you mind terribly if I haggled?

Staff:
Huh?

Tsumugi:
Could you see your way to lowering a price on a guitar?

Staff:
Uh... Ah! Y-you're the company president's daughter! Ah! Uh...! Hm...! Perhaps... I could go this low?

Tsumugi:
Hm. No, try again!

Tsumugi:
He says that he will sell you this guitar for $500.

Ritsu:
Serious?!

Yui:
What?! What did you say to him?

Tsumugi:
The thing is, this store is my family's business consortium.

Yui:
Really, is that so? Wow! Mugi, I don't know how to thank you! I'll pay you back the rest, I promise!

Yui:
Hehehe... It's so cute!
Bowrrm! Oh, I look like a rocker! Hehe... Oh! I gotta practice signing my autograph! Huh?

Ui:
Big Sis, could you keep it down...

Ui:
Hey Sis, if you don't get up soon, you'll be late for school! Big Sister?
Uh... She slept with it...

Ritsu:
Oh, yeah! Awesome!

Mio:
Wow, that guitar looks like it belongs on you.

Ritsu:
Try playing something!

Ui:
Uh...

Mio:
You really haven't practiced at all yet, have you?

Yui:
Well, the guitar is all bright and shiny and new and everything. And I guess, I'm just a little scared to touch it.

Mio:
Yeah, I can totally relate to that.

Yui:
I posed in front of the mirror with it, and then took a lot of pictures of it, and slept all night with it, though.

Ritsu:
So play it.

Mio:
You haven't even taken the film off of it yet.

Ritsu:
Ahh...
I couldn't help myself!

Yui:
Ah!

Mio:
Ritsu, apologize!

Ritsu:
I'm sorry! I acted on impulse! Please, forgive me!

Tsumugi:
Here, why don't you have a snack.

Mio:
Oh, something like that won't... It made her feel better!

Yui:
No, you're right. The purpose of a guitar is to be played by someone. And so, it's not right to just admire it and never use it. Thanks for that, Ritsu. I really needed that motivation.

Ritsu:
It was?! Well, I was kinda hoping it would give you the urge to practice. Boy, I'm goo... Ow!

Mio:
So, shall we practice, then?

Yui:
How do I get the guitar to sound like they do in a concert?

Mio:
You've just got to hook it up to an amp.

Ritsu:
Ready!

Yui:
Heh! That was awesome!

Mio:
It's finally started.

Ritsu:
We've got our Light Music Club.

Tsumugi:
Indeed.

Ritsu:
All right, Budokan, here we come!
By the time we graduate!

Yui:
I'm sorry. That's all I can play right now. I guess I should learn a lot more before I try playing with an amp.

Mio:
Ah! Be careful!

Yui:
Huh?

Mio:
That's what happens when you pull off the guitar cord before you turn the amp all the way down.

Yui:
You should've said something sooner...

Preview
Yui:
Ah! We've got midterm exams?!

Nodoka:
Is that a chord. too?

Ritsu:
I don't get it, Yui. Why didn't you study?

Yui:
Well, I really had planned to, but I... Come on, when you study for a test, don't you ever end up fixating on everything but studying?
Oh, look at that! It's sweet bean jelly!
Part A
Yui:
Guitar strings sure are scary. They're thin and tough, and I'm scared I'll cut my fingers.

Ritsu:
You got that right!
If you're not careful, you'll slice your fingers to the bone, and blood will spurt everywhere!

Mio:
Aiiieee!

Yui:
Mio, why did you scream?

Mio:
I-I can't stand all that gory talk!

Yui:
Don't worry Mio, I'm fine. See? I'm not really bleeding. I'm perfectly okay.

Mio:
Oh... Ahem!
Your fingertips will toughen up the more you play and practice, so I can almost promise you that you won't be doing any bleeding. Here. Check it out.

Yui:
Oh! Wow, Mio, you're right! They're all squishy! Squishy, squishy, squishy... Squishy, squishy...

Mio:
Um, are you about done?

Yui:
No, let me squeeze them some more!

Opening Song
Cagayake!GIRLS by 放課後ティータイム(After School Tea Time)

Yui:
I know I'm supposed to practice, but I have absolutely no idea where I should even start.

Mio:
Here.

Yui:
Huh?

Mio:
You should probably start yourself off by learning all of the chords.

Yui:
Wow, thank you!
Um, could you please teach me how to read musical notation first?

Mio:
You don't even know that?!

Ritsu:
See ya!

Mio:
Bye bye!

Yui:
See you tomorrow!
Let's see... A "C" goes like this, and this is a "D"...

Nodoka:
Yui!

Yui:
Nodoka!

Nodoka:
What's that? A new kind of greeting?

Yui:
The thing is, I had them teach me a bunch of guitar chords today!

Nodoka:
Wow, sounds like you're really working hard.

Yui:
Speaking of which, you're heading home a lot later than usual today.

Nodoka:
Mm, I spent the afternoon in the library studying for our midterms.

Yui:
Oh...
Ah! We've got midterm exams?!

Nodoka:
Is that a chord, too?

Yui:
Oh, wow... It's time for midterms already? And here I was all set to buckle down and really practice my guitar...

Nodoka:
Oh, come on now, Yui.
It's not like you've studied for a single test since middle school.

Yui:
Oh, yeah, that's right! Well, I guess it's all good, then!

Nodoka:
Um, I wouldn't exactly say that...

Ritsu:
We're finally free of all those tests!

Tsumugi:
It's terrible, the way they suddenly got harder once we got into high school.

Mio:
That's for sure. And I... see someone who's had an even harder time than we did.
Did your tests go that badly, Yui?

Yui:
Seems I'm the only one in my class who has to take a make-up...

Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Oh...

Tsumugi:
E-everything will be fine! I'm sure it's just that you didn't really study properly this time.

Ritsu:
Mugi's right! Just study real hard, and you'll ace that make-up test easy!

Yui:
Actually, I didn't study for it at all.

Ritsu:
I take back my words of encouragement, you flake!

Ritsu:
I don't get it, Yui. Why didn't you study?

Yui:
Well, I really had planned to, but I... Come on, when you study for a test, don't you ever end up fixating on everything but studying?

Ritsu:
Ah, I know what that's like. Like when I gotta clean up my room and stuff.

Yui:
I practiced on the guitar when I was taking a break from studying, and I couldn't put it down. In the end, I didn't get any studying done at all. But... my time wasn't wasted, 'cause I learned a whole bunch of chords!

Ritsu:
How about applying those powers of concentration to your studying, huh?

Yui:
You're a big talker. How did you do, Ritsu?

Ritsu:
Huh? Who, me? Passed with flying colors, thank you very much!

Yui:
You know, this doesn't really fit with your character...

Ritsu:
When you're a brilliant renaissance girl like me, everything comes quite easily to you!

Yui:
Yeah, but I was always under the impression that you were just like me!

Mio:
Who was it that showed up on my doorstep in tears the night before the exam?

Ritsu:
Hey, she doesn't need to know that!

Yui:
Now that's the Ritsu I know.

Ritsu:
I don't wanna hear that from somebody who flunked a test!

Yui:
How about the two of you? How did you do on your tests?

Tsumugi:
Here.

Yui:
Uh... Oh!

Ritsu:
O-oh, well you know, how it goes sometimes. I just made a bunch of dumb mistakes. That's all!

Yui:
Mm-hm.

Ritsu:
Have a heart, please say something!

Yui:
On another day...
Thank you for your time.
Oh, look at that! It's sweet bean jelly!
They said I'm banned from all club activities until I pass the make-up exam.

Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Ah!

Mio:
Wow, Yui, that's pretty harsh...

Ritsu:
Well, then, is it okay for you to even be here?

Yui:
Oh, sure, it's okay. I'm just here to eat sweets with my good friends.

Ritsu:
All right! Then everything is fine!
How do you say that it's okay?!

Mio:
If you're banned from participating in clubs, that means our club will be back down to three members.

Ritsu:
Huh? No way! Are you saying that we'll...

Mio:
We won't meet the minimum requirement.

Ritsu:
We'll be... disbanded?

Tsumugi:
When is your make-up test?

Yui:
One week from today.

Mio:
A week from today, huh?

Yui:
Well, with that much time, it's okay for me to come here every day, right?

Ritsu:
That's not much time at all!

Mio:
Yui, if you don't pass your test next week, the Light Music Club might very well cease to exist.

Yui:
Yeah, you're right. I wanna keep doing fun stuff with you guys, so I'll work real hard!

Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Hmm...

Yui:
Okay, time to study. Let's do this!
How did I let this get so messy?
Hm? Wow, it's that late? I have to bathe and get to bed!

Ritsu:
Meetings sure aren't as worthwhile without Yui here.

Mio:
That hasn't seemed to affect your appetite.

Ritsu:
Uh, no, Mio. Those two things have absolutely nothing to do with each other.

Tsumugi:
I wonder if Yui is devoting herself to her studying?

Ritsu:
Oh, I'm sure she's doing fine.

Yui:
Hm, for X squared minus Y squared, subtract by Y squared and divided by X, so x eqauls Y squared divided by X. See, I can do this if I set my mind to it! Huh?
This is X squared Y minus 4Y, so I start by factoring out the Y, leaving me with X squared minus 4...

Mio:
Yui's studying has to be coming along well, right?

Ritsu:
You know, I've been wondering that, too.
All right, now I'm really getting worried, guys.

Tsumugi:
Hey, I know. Why don't we all send her an encouraging text tonight?

Ritsu:
Ah! Good idea!

Mio:
I'm gonna send it as soon as I get home!

Yui:
Hm? Oh, hey, it's from Mio. Mm-hm. Message received.
It's from Mugi-chan!
Thank you so much, Mugi-chan!
It's from Ritchan!
Huh?

Ritsu:
Ah!

Yui:
No matter how hard I try, I just don't have the focus that I need. But with this, I'm gonna be just fine! All right, I'll use this book to boost my concentration for the first five minutes.
It's no use! I just can't read this! No, no, no, no! The problem is that I always give up before I even start!

Yui:
And that's why I need you to help me, Mio!

Mio:
You mean that you didn't do any studying at all?

Yui:
I just couldn't do it!

Ritsu:
Huh?

Tsumugi:
But if you don't get a passing grade, we'll...

Yui:
That's the last thing I want to have happen!

Mio:
Hmm... We'll have to have a cram session tonight.

Yui:
You mean it?

Ritsu:
Listen, if you have Mio teaching you, you're gonna pass your exams for sure! She's really great at cramming information into your head!

Mio:
I'm gonna teach her normally, darn it!

Part B
Yui:
My dad had to go away on a business trip, and my mom decided to go with him, so we don't have to worry about disturbing anyone.

Ritsu:
Hey, didn't you say that you also had a little sister?

Yui:
Mm, yeah, and I'm pretty sure she'll be at home tonight.

Tsumugi:
Well, if she's home, won't we just be a bother to her?

Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Yui's little sister, huh?

Ui:
--Big Sister!

Yui:
--Little Sister!

Ui:
--Big Sister!

Ritsu:
I think we'll be pretty safe on that score!

Yui:
Come on in, everyone.

Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Thanks having us over.

Ritsu:
Oh..,

Tsumugi:
Oh...

Ui:
Hi, welcome home, Sis. Oh, are these your friends?
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Yui's sister, Ui. Thank you for looking out for my sister.

Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Uh... Oh...

Ui:
Here are some slippers for you.

Everyone:
So polite and mature!

Ritsu:
Wow... Hard to believe two sisters could be so different.

Yui:
Different how?

Ritsu:
It's almost like your little sister managed to get all the good traits in the family.

Yui:
What?!

Ui:
Excuse me. I brought some tea if anyone would like some. And sorry, I'm afraid these are the only snacks we have for you.

Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
She really is polite and mature!

Ritsu:
So, what grade are you in, Ui?

Ui:
I'm in ninth grade.

Ritsu:
Oh, just one year behind us!

Tsumugi:
Taking your entrance exams?

Ui:
Just about.

Mio:
Do you know which high school you want to go to?

Ui:
Mm... I'd like to go to Sakuragaoka if I can manage it. But I'm not sure if I'm a good enough student to get in.

Ritsu:
You sister managed to get in, so I'm sure you'll do fine.

Yui:
Join us, join us!

Mio:
You just got to get your sister to help you study, that's all.

Yui:
Yup!

Ui:
I, uh... I'd rather do it all by myself.

Ritsu:
Boy, she shot you down!

Yui:
Why? I can study just as good as anybody!

Ui:
But you know, my sister can do anything once she sets her mind to it.

Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Definitely polite and mature.

Mio:
All right, we don't have a lot of time, so this is gonna be concentrated.

Yui:
Mm-hm.

Mio:
Page 20 in the book. This expression.

Yui:
Mm.

Mio:
What do you get when you expand it using this one?

Yui:
Hmm.

Ritsu:
Whee!

Mio:
Here.

Yui:
Oh, I get it.

Ritsu:
Oh, manga!

Mio:
Would you shut up!

Yui:
Ugh. My feet are asleep again.

Ritsu:
Poke.

Yui:
Ah!

Mio:
Ritsu!

Yui:
It's no use! I just can't concentrate anymore!

Mio:
Come on, now, Yui. It's only been 30 minutes since we started working.

Tsumugi:
Yui, when you're done studying, we can all eat this cake that I brought, so hang in there a while longer, okay?

Mio:
Attagirl, Mugi!

Ritsu:
Hm, how can I get back in there?
Oh, hello, girls! I see y'all hard at work.
Hmm... Well, that didn't work.
Yay! It's me, everybody!
Mhm... I needed an entrance with more impact.
Yeahhh! Hi-yaaa! Ho-yaaa! Attention all present! I am co--

Mio:
Shut up!

Yui:
This is so great!

Ritsu:
Cake like this makes life worth living.

Mio:
Boy, what kind of life do you two lead, anyway?

Ui:
Coming!

Yui:
I wonder who that is?

Yui:
Oh, hi, Nodoka!

Nodoka:
So, are you making any progress?

Yui:
I am. Thanks for asking.

Nodoka:
Your friends from the Light Music Club?

Yui:
Let me introduce you. This is Mio Akiyama. And Ritsu Tainaka. And this is Tsumugi Kotobuki.

Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Nice to meet you.

Nodoka:
Nice to meet you, too. My name is Nodoka Manabe. Yui and I have been friends forever. We even ended up in the same class in high school.

Yui:
Yeah, we've been together pretty much since kindergarten.

Nodoka:
We have this weird connection. Anyway, I thought you all might get hungry so I brought you some sandwiches.

Yui:
Great timing, I was just getting hungry!

Mio:
Didn't you just finish eating cake?

Ritsu:
No problem at all! Just pass them over here! Thank you!

Nodoka:
In middle school, I came down with a bad fever and had to miss classes for a while. Yui came over every day to bring me that day's syllabus and homework.

Yui:
I've actually never been sick a day in my life!

Nodoka:
One day, she accidentally left one of her test papers in the daily syllabus that she brought over.

Ritsu:
You haven't changed one bit!

Nodoka:
But she really was a huge help to me.

Yui:
Hehehe...

Mio:
Reminds me of that time, Ritsu...

Ritsu:
Ah! No, don't tell them that!

Yui:
She what? Tell us!

Mio:
You're not going to believe this, but Ritsu actually...

Yui:
You did it!

Nodoka:
By the way, are you done studying?

Yui & Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi & Ui:
Uh...

Mio:
All right, everything we've covered so far will be on the test. In the case of X squared minus XY minus 6Y squared plus 2X minus Y plus 1, you want to first simplify by trying to factor out the common factor of X. Now, when we do that, what we end up with is, X squared minus the sum of Y minus 2, and X minus 6Y suared minus Y plus 1, equals X squared minus the sum of Y minus 2 times the sum of 2Y plus 1...
Wake up!

Tsumugi:
Please, get up!

Yui:
Huh? Where am I?

Mio:
Yui, stay awake! You'll die if you doze off!

Yui:
I came this close to falling asleep! Wait a minute. Commander, I don't see Squad Member Ritsu here!
Ah! She's outside, and she's... playing!

Mio:
It pains me to say it, but there's absolutely nothing I can do for her.

Yui:
Oh! No!

Mio:
Hey, Yui.

Yui:
Oh, Squad Member Ritsu! May fortune... smile upon you!

Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Huh?

Yui:
The sum of X minus 2Y plus 4 times the sum of X minus Y minus 1... Yes! I'm all done!

Mio:
Well, I think you've got the hang of it now.

Tsumugi:
You'll be able to ace the make-up test.

Yui:
Thanks, Mio-chan, and Thanks you, Mugi-chan!

Tsumugi:
I think it's time we called it a night.

Mio:
Hey, where's Ritsu?

Ritsu:
Aww! I lost again!

Mio:
She's getting way too cozy. Wait, "lost again"?!

Teacher:
Very well, begin!

Mio:
I wonder how Yui is doing?

Ritsu:
Aw, I think she's gonna be just fine.

Mio:
Isn't that thing you should worry more?!

Sawako:
Ah, Miss Hirasawa.

Yui:
Ms. Yamanaka.

Sawako:
So, how did your test go?

Yui:
It went...

Sawako:
It certainly looks like you studied hard for it. As long as you don't give up, you're sure to succeed eventually!

Mio:
Yui gets her results today, right? I wonder if she was able to pass this time?

Tsumugi:
After all the studying, I'm sure she did fine.

Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Hm?

Mio:
Well, how did you do?

Yui:
What am I gonna do, Mio?

Mio:
You mean you failed again?!

Yui:
I-I got a hundred!

Mio:
You got a what?!

Mio:
Thank goodness. Now all of your tests are behind you for the time being.

Tsumugi:
Yeah, she's right.

Yui:
I couldn't have done it without you guys! Thank you so much!

Ritsu:
Aw, well, it was nothing!

Mio:
You didn't do a damn thing to help!

Tsumugi:
Let's get right down to practicing, then, shall we?

Mio:
Now, you were practicing your chords while you were studying, weren't you? Why don't you try playing something.

Yui:
Hehe. I have it down cold! Ask me anything! X, Y, whatever!

Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Hmm...

Mio:
All right, then, why don't you play us a C chord followed by an A minor 7, a D minor 7, and then a G7.

Yui:
Sure thing!

Mio:
What's the matter?

Yui:
I forgot how!

Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Ah...

Yui:
It's all of the X and Y stuff I've been studying.

Mio:
So you're back to square one?!

Yui:
Um, let me see. Was this an X?

Mio:
Wait, I've never seen that chord before.

Yui:
Oh, it's brand-new. See, it's like this! Mio, I'm positive this is an X!

Mio:
But there's no such thing as an X chord!

Ritsu:
You can play that?

Mio:
We're having a training camp!

Yui:
Training camp?

Mio:
That's right. For one thing summer vacation is almost here.

Ritsu:
We're going to the beach?! Or maybe to the mountains?!

Mio:
We're not going out there to play around! This will be a band training camp! We'll be practicing nonstop from sunup to sundown!

Tsumugi:
Yeah, definitely! Let's go! I've always dreamed of having a sleepover with you all.
Part A
Yui:
It's summer!

Ritsu:
It's the beach!
Oh!

Mio:
It's so pretty...

Yui:
It's sparkling!

Ritsu:
Mm, ready, let's swim!

Yui:
Yeah!

Mio:
You guys, be careful and don't get carried away, okay?!

Ritsu:
Yui, the water is all salty!

Yui:
Because it's saltwater, Ritchan!

Ritsu:
Yui, there're waves here!

Yui:
Oh, there're waves, Ritchan!

Mio:
They're not listening to a word I said...

Mio:
Hm? Light Music Club?
Hm... Sakura High Festival?

Yui:
Let's see... Ow! My finger!

Ritsu:
You really did forget how to play.

Yui:
Huh? My grandma used to compliment me all the time.
"Yui," she said, "as soon as you learn one thing, everything else seems to leave your head."

Ritsu:
I don't think that was a compliment.

Yui:
Oh, Mio!

Ritsu:
Where have you been?

Yui:
Huh?

Mio:
We're having a training camp!

Yui:
Training camp?

Mio:
That's right. Summer vacation is almost here.

Ritsu:
We're going to the beach?! Or maybe to the mountains?!

Mio:
We're not going out there to play around! This will be a band training camp! We'll be practicing nonstop from sunup to sundown.

Yui:
I'd better buy new clothes to wear!

Ritsu:
Yeah, I need to buy a swimsuit, too.

Mio:
Listen!
Pretty soon after the end of summer vacation is the high school festival.

Ritsu:
"High school festival"?

Mio:
Yes! In the past, the Light Music Club was pretty famous for its incredible live performances at the Sakura High Festival. That festival is...

Ritsu:
Wow, the school festival!

Yui:
School festivals at high schools are pretty elaborate, right?

Ritsu:
Concession!

Yui:
Yakisoba!

Ritsu:
Takoyaki!

Ritsu & Yui:
Hahaha.

Ritsu:
I know! I really want to have a full-on maid café!

Yui:
A-a haunted house would be a lot better!

Ritsu:
A maid café!

Yui:
A haunted house!

Ritsu:
A maid café!

Yui:
I said a haunted house!

Ritsu:
No, a maid café is the way to go! Argh!
How come you only whacked me?

Mio:
We're the Light Music Club, aren't we? We are performing!

Tsumugi:
Hello, everyone. Sorry, I'm late. Huh?

Ritsu:
Ow... ow...

Tsumugi:
Would you like some madeleines?

Tsumugi:
Goodness.

Mio:
So, what do you think, Mugi? I know at the beginning, I said we should take things slowly, but I mean, come on, it's been three months now. We haven't played together a single time.

Tsumugi:
Now, now, now, now, now, now...

Yui:
Six times.

Ritsu:
What?

Tsumugi:
Oh! Yeah, definitely! Let's go! I've always dreamed of having a sleepover with you all.

Yui:
Really, you have?

Ritsu:
So, should we go out to the beach? Oh, how about...

Mio:
I told you, this is going to be a training camp for the band!

Yui:
Uh, how much is this training camp going to cost?

Ritsu:
You know, she's right. We're on a tight budget.

Mio:
I hadn't thought of that... Hey, Mugi?

Tsumugi:
Yes?

Mio:
Do you have a summer house?

Tsumugi:
Yes, of course.

Yui & Mio & Ritsu:
Oh! Of course she does!

Ui:
Sis?
Come on, Sis! How about getting out of bed already? And aren't those my pajamas?

Yui:
A little longer, please...

Ui:
You're just hopeless.
Hm? Um, Big Sister?

Yui:
What time is it?

Ui:
Um, uh...

Yui:
Hello.

Mio:
Good morning.

Yui:
A fine morning to you, too.
I'm sorry!

Yui:
Boy, I can't believe I made it...

Ritsu:
Yeah, and after we warned you not to oversleep, too.

Yui:
Sorry, I was way too excited to get a good night's sleep.

Ritsu:
What are you, a grade-schooler?

Yui:
Hehehe...

Mio:
Yeah, well, seems she's not the only one.

Yui:
She's asleep. Well, she did say this was her dream.

Tsumugi:
The gel type will be fine.

Mio:
Gel?!

Yui:
Hey, I wonder what she's dreaming about right now?

Ritsu:
You know, I think we need to get a picture of this.

Yui:
Cut it out, that'd be really mean!

Ritsu:
It's for our memory album!

Tsumugi:
Oh, I'm so sorry.

Yui:
You see, you woke her up.

Ritsu:
I'm sorry about that! So, now that you're awake, you really gotta tell us. Where is this cool summer home of yours?

Tsumugi:
Ah! Let's see...
Almost there.

Yui:
Ah!

Ritsu:
Wow!

Mio:
The beach.

Tsumugi:
Yes, the beach.

Ritsu:
Yui!

Ritsu & Yui:
Ready and... Pull!

Yui:
Smell that salty air!

Ritsu:
Swimming! Yeah!

Mio:
I told you, we didn't come here to play!

Ritsu & Yui:
Yeah!

Ritsu:
It's huge!

Tsumugi:
To be honest, I had hoped to stay in one of our larger vacation houses, but unfortuetly, I only got permission to borrow our smallest.

Ritsu:
This is your smallest house. This?

Ritsu:
Hahaha.

Yui:
Wow, look at all this space!

Ritsu:
This is amazing!

Mio:
Huh? What's this?

Tsumugi:
Oh my, I'm sorry! I said that they didn't need to leave anything out for us, but I guess they did.

Ritsu:
Mugi, what's in here?!

Yui & Ritsu:
Oh!

Yui:
Oh, it's a princess bed!

Ritsu:
Whoa!
Wow! Look at that!

Tsumugi:
I'm so sorry. I always tell them that I'd like things to be as normal as possible. They just don't seem to understand what that means.

Tsumugi:
Come in.
It hasn't been used recently, so I'm worried that the gear might not work properly.

Mio:
Well, everything looks okay! Uh. Hey, where are Yui and Ritsu?

Tsumugi:
I don't know. They wandered off at some point.

Mio:
Those two are hopeless.

Tsumugi:
What's that?

Mio:
Oh, you mean this? It's a past Light Music Club playing at the school festival. I found it in the clubroom earlier.

Tsumugi:
They're good.

Mio:
Yeah, they're way, way better than we are.

Tsumugi:
Yes.

Mio:
When I heard this, it's like I had this sudden urge not to be outdone by them.

Tsumugi:
So, is that why you suggested this training camp?

Mio:
Yeah, but we're...

Tsumugi:
I don't think we will. I know we can do this.

Mio:
Mugi...

Ritsu:
Yeah! Time to have some fun!

Yui:
Oh, yeah!

Mio:
Well, that was fast! What about practice?!

Yui:
We're gonna go on ahead, so you two hurry up and get changed!

Mio:
You still sure?

Tsumugi:
Y-yes, I think...

Ritsu:
Hey!

Yui:
Hurry up!

Tsumugi:
Wait, I'll be right there!
Come on, Mio, shall we?

Mio:
Wait! You mean you're gonna go with them?

Tsumugi:
We may as well enjoy ourselves a little while we're here. Right?

Mio:
But I thought we'd...

Ritsu:
Mugi, we're going!

Tsumugi:
Coming!
They'll all be waiting for you.

Mio:
Wait for me! I'm going, too!

Part B
Yui:
It's been two weeks since we tragically washed ashore on this desert island...

Ritsu:
Yes, although I thought we were done for when we were cast adrift.

Yui:
Still, you gotta admit this is kind of fun in its own way.

Ritsu:
What a grand find...
Uh. Seems we're saved...

Yui:
Tonight we feast...

Mio:
What kind of crazy scenario are you acting out?

Yui:
Mio, you're...

Mio:
Hm?

Ritsu:
Eat this! Come on, Yui! Let's swim!

Yui:
Right!

Mio:
That hurt. Then again... Mm-hm, this sure is a pretty place.

Yui:
C'mon, tell me, what did you draw?

Tsumugi:
It just grew to this size before I knew it.

Mio:
I'm not scared, I'm not scared, I'm not scared, I'm not scared, I'm not scared, I'm not scared, I'm not scared, I'm not scared, I'm not scared...

Ritsu:
When you go to the doctor, your kneecaps will be covered with corn barnacles.

Yui:
I swallowed seawater...!

Ritsu:
We've made it at last to the golden island of Zipangu!

Mio:
The day's not over.

Ritsu:
Huh? When did you get that?

Mio:
We're here at the beach and all. It's a beautiful day and if we don't live it up, what was the point of coming all this way and...
Wah! Practice!

Ritsu:
What, you forgot about that?

Mio:
It's all your fault, Ritsu, with your going on and on about goofing off.

Ritsu:
Oh, yeah? Well, which of us do you think was having the most fun, huh?

Mio:
Uh...

Ritsu:
I'm so stuffed...

Yui:
Ah... The floor feels wonderfully nice and cool... When you close your eyes, it almost feels like you're being carried far away out to sea by the ocean waves, doesn't it?

Ritsu:
Hey, you're right, it does...

Yui:
Good night, Ritchan...

Ritsu:
Yeah, you too...

Mio:
Hey, come on, guys. We're starting!

Tsumugi:
You need to get up, you two!

Mio:
Hey, Mugi, stand back for a minute.

Ritsu:
Oh, c'mon, can't we just call it a day.

Mio:
We came here to practice, and so that's what we're gonna do!

Ritsu:
Yeah, but we're tired...

Mio:
I've been meaning to ask, have you been putting on a bit weight lately?

Ritsu:
Oh!

Mio:
Especially around your mid-section.

Ritsu:
Huh?!

Mio:
Maybe it's because you haven't been playing the drums lately.

Ritsu:
Ah! Ah! Ah!

Yui:
I can't hold this anymore.

Mio:
Eh?

Yui:
This guitar feels like it weighs a ton.

Mio:
That's why I told you before you bought it that you should get a lighter one!

Yui:
Who was it that told me to buy this guitar?

Mio:
You did!

Yui:
The floor's warmed up. It's not as comfortable...

Ritsu:
Yeah...

Ritsu & Yui:
Roll... roll... roll...

Tsumugi:
Careful, you'll get dirty.

Yui:
This spot's nice and cool...

Mio:
How did you expect to play in the school festival if we don't practice?

Ritsu:
Oh, come on, I told you that we should do a maid café!

Yui:
I still think we should do a haunted house!

Mio:
Uh...

Ritsu:
Ugh... Yui, you're not following me at all. Look closely at Mio.

Mio:
Wh-what's this got to do with me?

Ritsu:
Let's face it, Mio.
There aren't many people in this world better suited to the maid look than you.

Yui:
Yeah.

Ritsu:
Black stockings! A lily-white apron! And a maid headband!

Mio:
The adorable power of cute compels you! Love![1]

Ritsu:
And she'd have a catchphrase like that!

Yui:
That might be really cute!

Ritsu:
Just kidding. Relax...

Yui:
S-Squad Member Ritsu...

Mio:
When we're done with this, we're really gonna start practicing, got it?

Ritsu:
We know, we know!

Tsumugi:
Mm-hm.

Yui & Ritsu:
One, two!

Yui:
And now for our last number! Let's do it!
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Huh? Wait! It's over already?

Ritsu:
Budget issues.

Tsumugi:
We'll do it again soon.

Ritsu:
Yeah, they're gonna be going off like crazy at our Budokan show, right?!

Yui:
Budokan show?

Ritsu:
Huh? That's what we all settled on as our goal, remember?
Right?

Mio:
Huh?

Yui:
In that case, I want the fireworks to be pink!

Ritsu:
Mm, what are you, a grade-schooler?

Yui:
Oh, but it'd be cute!

Ritsu:
We'd look like a bunch of kids!

Tsumugi:
I think pink would be a little much, too.

Yui:
Aw, you really think so?

Mio:
If all we're going to do is try to play at the Budokan, then we need to get at least as good as this.

Ritsu:
Wow, they're good.

Yui:
Huh? I think I could play this song...

Death Devil:
I've been waiting for you people to arrive...
Now die!

Yui:
What was that?

Tsumugi:
The tape must have switched over to side B.

Ritsu:
Uh, all right. Hm?

Mio:
I'm not listening, I'm not listening, I'm not listening, I'm not listening, I'm not listening, I'm not listening...

Ritsu:
Scary ghosts...In a scary haunted house!

Mio:
Stop it! Please... No more... Please...

Tsumugi:
Ritsu.

Yui:
You overdid it.

Ritsu:
Hm... Mio, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that.

Yui:
You see, Mio. Everything's okay, now.

Tsumugi:
It wasn't a ghost on the tape.

Mio:
Really?

Yui & Ritsu:
Sparkly!
The power of cute compels you!

Ritsu:
I'm really sorry.

Mio:
Hm.

Tsumugi:
Hey, Yui, did you really mean what you said about that song?

Yui:
Yeah, watch this!
Let's see...

Tsumugi:
Oh...

Ritsu:
No way...

Yui:
There! How was it?

Tsumugi:
Wow, that was perfect!

Yui:
Hehehe... Thanks, but not quite. I don't know how to make it go "myon".

Ritsu:
"Myon"?

Mio:
Wait a minute, I think you must be talking about choking.

Ritsu:
This choking?

Mio:
Guess again.
Choking is when you pull on the strings to bend them and change the sound while a note is being played.
You do it like this.

Yui:
Oh, wow!

Mio:
See?

Yui:
Do this... and this?

Mio:
Yeah, that!

Yui:
That sounds funny!

Mio:
Uh... Funny how?

Ritsu:
Like a spook afraid of ghosts?

Mio:
Ghosts!

Yui:
Ah! I can't believe you even have an outdoor bath...

Tsumugi:
I certainly had a lot of fun today.

Mio:
Yeah. Maybe you were right, Mugi. Maybe I should just try to relax a bit and not worry so much.

Ritsu:
Then we should've had a lot more fun!

Mio:
Who are you?!

Ritsu:
It's Ritsu!

Mio:
Well, your bangs are long.

Ritsu:
Got a problem with that?

Tsumugi:
They're long, but surprisingly cute.

Ritsu:
Oh, thanks! Wait a second, what do you mean by "surprisingly"?

Tsumugi:
Oh, I'm sorry.

Yui:
Hm...

Mio:
I think you're trying for this.

Yui:
Wow! You can tell? Amazing!

Mio:
Now, all you need to is stick out your ring finger.

Yui:
Oh, I get it! Ugh!

Mio:
A-are you all right?

Yui:
Ow, ow...
Music is a wonderful thing, isn't it? It was so much fun playing music together with everybody for the first time today.

Mio:
Yui...

Yui:
And I would've missed out on it if you hadn't suggested having a training camp. Thanks, Mio-chan!

Mio:
Uh... Uh, well...

Ritsu:
It looks like Mio's all embarrassed.

Mio:
I am not! I'm red from the heat, and that's all!

Ritsu:
You're not fooling anyone.

Mio:
You're wrong, all right?! So just drop it!

Ritsu:
Uh-oh, Mio's mad!

Mio:
Why, you... Come back here, darn it!

Ritsu:
Ooh, scary!

Mio:
Come back here!

Ritsu:
Is anyone home?

Mio:
Coming! I'll be right there!
So, you said the pictures from the training camp are ready?

Ritsu:
Yep! Right here.

Mio:
Ah! Wow!
Ah! Hehehe.
Ah!

Ritsu:
Haha! That one turned out great. Actually, I have that shot of...

Mio:
Hand over the negatives now.

Ritsu:
I-it's a digital camera, there's no negatives...

Ritsu:
Come on, Mio! We're starting!

Mio:
Yeah, hang on! I'll just be a minute!

Hm, I don't see it listed anywhere.

Oh, no. You kidding...

Wait, don't tell me...

Yui:
Ms. Yamanaka, did you used to play the guitar?

Sawako:
No, but some old friends of mine did.

Ritsu:
This was in that cardboard box you found the other day, Mio. They look like pictures of an old Light Music Club.

Yui:
That's amazing! I knew you can do it, Nodoka!

Nodoka:
Who's your advisor?

Yui: & Mio: & Ritsu: & Tsumugi:
Advisor?
Yui:
Hey, Ritchan.

Ritsu:
Hey there, Yui.

Yui:
Ugh, so hot... Huh? What's that you're looking at?

Ritsu:
I found something interesting. Here, check it out.

Yui:
Wow, what's with these pictures?

Ritsu:
They were in a cardboard box that Mio found earlier. They're pictures of a past Light Music Club.

Yui:
Wow, these are amazing!

Ritsu:
They got that look every band has, no matter when in history they played.

Yui:
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Say the word "band," and this used to be the only image that popped into my head.

Maybe we can just try changing this a little bit.

Ritsu:
Hmm...

Yui:
Ow!

Ritsu:
What happened?

Yui:
I scraped the skin off my finger.

Ritsu:
Whoa, that looks painful.

Yui:
You, too, Mio! Look at my finger!

Yui & Ritsu:
Hm?

Mio:
I'm not looking, I'm not listening. I'm not looking, I'm not listening. I'm not looking, I'm not listening. I'm not looking, I'm not listening.

Ritsu:
Hehehe... Ah, that hurts! I've been practicing drums too much. The blisters on my hand broke open!
Hahaha... Take a look! It's gross! Disgusting! Boo! Check it out! Zipping! Killing! You! In your face! Dah! Near you! That's it! Lookit! You! Ha-ha! There!

Yui:
Ritchan, do we have any adhesive bandages here?

Sawako:
Don't mind me.
I just need to borrow these music stands. Oh?

Teacher:
Would the two of you mind carrying these notebooks for me?

Tsumugi:
Thank you very much for all your help.

Yui:
Ow!

Tsumugi:
Huh?

Yui:
The antiseptic's really stinging!

Sawako:
I know. All right, hold your finger still just like that.

Yui:
What a tidy desk...

Sawako:
Done. There, that should do it.

Yui:
Thanks for your help, Ms. Yamanaka.

Sawako:
Let's see the others.

Yui:
Um...

Sawako:
Well, you have a ways to go. The way your skin is right now, it's going to peel off soon.[1]

Yui:
Huh?

Sawako:
Your skin will get tougher each time this happens, and you'll become a better player in the process. It's a guitarist's rite of passage.

Yui:
Oh, it is? Wait a sec! Did you used to play guitar, Ms. Yamanaka?

Sawako:
Not me. But I have some friends who did.

Yui:
Hmm...

Sawako:
Oh, very good work today.

Teacher:
You too.

Sawako:
See you later.

Yui:
U-uh, yes.

Sawako:
Hey, would you like some tea?

Teacher:
Yeah, thanks.

Yui:
What a nice teacher... Hm? Mugi-chan!

Tsumugi:
Ah!

Yui:
Mugi-chan, is something the matter?

Tsumugi:
No, I, uh, I was just thinking how pretty she was.

Yui:
Oh, you mean Ms. Yamanaka? By the way, where have you been?

Tsumugi:
Ah, well you see, I was asked by Mio to go find out if the Light Music Club could use the stage when we play at the school festival. But I'm afraid they turned our request down because they said we weren't recognized as a legitimate club yet.

Yui:
Oh, that's nice...
Hm? Eh?

Ritsu:
We're not recognized as a legitimate club?!

Tsumugi:
No, apparently we are not.

Yui:
I thought, in order to be official, we just needed to have four members.

Ritsu:
Yeah, Yui. That's what I thought, too.

Yui:
You know, I was thinking, if we're not recognized as an official club, is it okay that we've been hogging the Music Room to ourselves?

Ritsu:
Look, nobody's said anything about it to us so far, so I'm sure it's okay. I think. More importantly, I'd better go and ask them why we're not recognized.

Tsumugi:
Yes, you should.

Ritsu:
Oh. Hey, what happened to Mio?

Yui:
Oh, if you're looking for Mio, she's still huddled in terror over there.

Ritsu:
Would you come back here?!

Yui:
Greetings, all!

Ritsu:
I'm Club President!

Nodoka:
Oh, Yui?

Yui:
Nodoka-chan? Wow, Nodoka-chan, what are you doing here?

Nodoka:
What do you mean? I'm here because I'm on the student council.

Yui:
Oh, that's amazing! That's my Nodoka-chan!

Ritsu:
So you two are really childhood friends?

Nodoka:
Well, sorry, but you don't seem to be on the list...

Yui:
Oh, no. You're kidding.

Ritsu:
No, don't tell me...

Yui:
Ritchan! Does this raise any theories?

Ritsu:
Yes. What this appears to be is a sinister plot by the student council to drive weak clubs to be disbanded!

Yui:
I know you're really a pure-hearted person, Nodoka-chan! Please, snap out of it!

Nodoka:
What are you talking about? Maybe you just didn't submit a club activities application form?

Tsumugi:
Club activities application?

Ritsu:
It's the first I've heard this form!

Mio:
No, it's not!

Ritsu:
Yes. That was... back in spring.
--I'm Club President, so I'll fill it out!

Mio:
--Are you sure, Ritsu?

Tsumugi:
--Excuse me, I brought a big pound cake with me today.

Ritsu:
--Oooh, let's dig in!

Mio:
--Hey, Ritsu, wait!

Ritsu:
--Mm, I know, I know, Mio! I'll fill it out just as soon as we finish eating! I'll fill it out just as soon as we finish eating! ...finish eating... ...finish eating...

Mio:
I knew it, this is all your fault! You're here putting things off!

Tsumugi:
Oh, dear. Mio, it's not like she did it deliberately.

Mio:
You're too soft on her, Mugi!

Tsumugi:
Now, now, now, now, now, now.

Nodoka:
How to put this... I think you're a perfect fit for the Light Music Club, Yui.

Huh?

Oh well, all right, Yui... I'll see what I can do for you.

Yui & Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Advisor?

Nodoka:
You don't have one?

Ritsu:
Sawako Yamanaka.
Our fair school's music teacher.
As a result of her beautiful features and gentle demeanor, she is popular with not only the student body, but also the school staff. Plus, her skill with instruments and her singing voice are remarkable.

Sawako:
What?

Ritsu:
She is popular enough to have her own fan club.

Sawako:
What have you been going on about?
Uh... Hello, girls...

Yui & Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Teacher!

Sawako:
What is it?

Ritsu:
Please agree to be the Light Music Club's advisor!

Sawako:
Oh, I see, you don't have an advisor yet...

Mio:
Ms. Yamanaka, you're the only teacher that we can turn to.

Tsumugi:
Oh, please do it.

Sawako:
I'm so sorry. I wish that I could be your advisor, I really do, but I'm already the school band's advisor, so there's no way I could handle another.

Yui:
You're kidding...

Sawako:
I really am sorry about this.

Ritsu:
She's so desirable that she's been courted by countless men.

Sawako:
Uh, Look, flattery isn't going to change anything!

We won't take up any of your time!

Tsumugi:
That's right! Because we always practice on our own!

Ritsu:
Just write your name here and give it your official stamp! Simple, huh?

Sawako:
J-just a sec!

Yui:
Stare...
Ms. Yamanaka, you graduated from here, didn't you?

Sawako:
Well, yes...

Yui:
We were looking through an old Light Music Club photo album earlier.

Mio:
Is something the matter with you?

Sawako:
Um, so, where is that album right now?

Yui:
Uh, well, it's in our club room.

Sawako:
I see.

Yui:
Ms. Yamanaka?

Sawako:
I would never have suspected that the last copy was being kept right here in the school. That book contains a chapter of my bloody past that must never come to light. A spawn of the devil that must never be awakened! A forbidden book never to be seen! A locked doorway that must never be opened! It's... It's... It's...
At last, it's over.

Ritsu:
I knew it! That was you, Ms. Yamanaka!

Yui:
You were this girl, weren't you?

Sawako:
Well played, if you've found me out. It's true, I was once a Light Music Club member.

Tsumugi:
I never suspected!

Yui:
Does that mean that this is you?

Sawako on tape:
--I've been waiting for you people to arrive! Now die!

Sawako:
Stop it! I'm so ashamed!

Mio:
I'm not listening, I'm not listening...

Ritsu:
You're still dragging out that shtick?

Tsumugi:
You were playing guitar, too?

Yui:
Hey, right! Play something! Don't be shy!

Sawako:
I can't! I can't!
Oh... The characteristic weight of a Les Paul's mahogany and maple... This dulcet tone, full of sweetly distorted harmonics from its humbucker pickup...

Yui:
Ms. Yamanaka?

Sawako:
Hahaha. What the hell...

Yui & Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Her expression's changed!

Mio:
She's shredding!

Tsumugi:
She's tapping!

Ritsu:
She's Hendrix-ing!

Yui:
Oh, no. My poor little guitar!

Sawako:
You sucks, you've been using the Music Room like it was yours!

Yui & Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Ah! We're so sorry!

Sawako:
And the first place you four-- Uh?!
Did you all see that?

Yui & Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Uh-huh.

Sawako:
Ugh! I swore to myself I'd put on a ladylike front when I became a teacher...

Ritsu:
Yeah, but Ms.--

Sawako:
All of this began eight long years ago...

Ritsu:
Why is she narrating all of a sudden?!

Sawako:
I was...

Part B
Sawako:
I was... in love.
--I love you.

Guy:
--I'm sorry. But I like girls with more of a wild streak in them.

Sawako:
And so I made up my mind. That I would become the girl of his dreams.
I would be wilder. Wilder! Wilder! Ever wilder! More! More! More! Wilder! Wilder! Wilder!
--I'll go out with you if you want!

Guy:
--Sawako... You took it too far.

Sawako:
I guess that's how it always ends, huh?

Yui:
You okay?

Sawako:
Please, spare me your words of comfort...

Ritsu:
Teacher, please lift up your eyes.

Sawako:
Oh, Ritchan!

Ritsu:
If you don't want this getting out, you will be our club advisor.

Yui:
Ritchan, you're so resolute!
Hm? Uh... Mugi-chan?

Mio:
What's wrong?

Yui:
I dunno, it's Mugi-chan...

Mio:
Mugi!

Yui:
Are you feeling okay? You look like you're kind of spacing out.

Tsumugi:
Oh... Uh...

Mio:
Hm?

Mio:
And that's a brand-new original piece we've been working on.

Sawako:
Hmm...

Ritsu:
As our advisor, what's your opinion?

Sawako:
I have some concerns, such as the intro and outro, and the way your rhythm section is all over the place, and total lack of any cohesive hook. But, don't you guys have a singer?

Yui & Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Ah!

Sawako:
Wait, you haven't written any lyrics yet, either, have you?

Yui:
Well, I guess we just...

Sawako:
You've got a lot of guts, thinking you could perform at the school festival in this state...

Mio:
We're sorry, ma'am.

Sawako:
What have you been doing every time you've been hogging the music room?! It's not a place to sit around and sip tea!

Yui:
We made her mad!

Sawako:
For one thing!

Tsumugi:
Teacher!
W-would you care for some yummy cake?

Sawako:
Yes, I would!

Yui & Mio & Ritsu:
She would?!

Mio:
Let's see... We should have started with the lyrics first.
Mugi?

Tsumugi:
"Now that Ms. Yamanaka has become our advisor, my heart is pounding for some reason. Good luck with the lyrics."

Mio:
"My heart is pounding"?
Nah, no way...

Yui & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
They're done?!

Mio:
Yeah... All done.

Yui:
Show us, show us!

Mio:
Already?!

Ritsu:
Yes, already!

Tsumugi:
I would love to see them, too!

Mio:
But... But I'm embarrassed to show them to you...

Yui:
Come on, Mio-chan. No one is gonna laugh.

Ritsu:
Yeah, yeah!

Mio:
But I... Wait a minute!

Ritsu:
We can't wait! If you brought them, that means you're ready to show them to us, right?!

Tsumugi:
Mio, come on, please!

Yui:
You can give me a little peek! Just one little peek!

Ritsu:
No fair! If anybody's going to see them, I'm gonna be first!

Yui:
Why, you?

Ritsu:
Why? Because I'm Club President, that's why!

Yui:
Wha...? Then I'm Mio-chan's soulmate! So I get to see them first. So, there!

Tsumugi:
Well then, I'm Mio-chan's soulmate number two! And I get to see them next!

Ritsu:
You got a lot of gall! I am the place that Mio's soul calls home, right?

Mio:
Since when?

Yui:
Oh, I wonder how my granny who lives out in the country is doing?

Ritsu:
That's got nothing to do with this.

Mio:
Did I send mine a New Year's card last year?

Ritsu:
Don't change the subject!

Sawako:
Let's see the damn thing!

Mio:
Ah!

Ritsu:
Ooh, let me see!

Sawako:
I wanna tear this up!

Ritsu:
I'm all itchy!

Mio:
I think that, considering how fast I did it, it turned out pretty well...

Ritsu & Sawako:
Huh?!

Mio:
Do you really think that it's no good?

Sawako:
"No good" might be a little strong...

Ritsu:
Yeah, more like it doesn't quite fit the image that we're trying to create.
C'mon, Yui, you haven't said anything. What do you think?

Yui:
It was so awesome...

Ritsu:
Seriously?!

Yui:
I love these lyrics. I think they're just wonderful!

Mio:
Y-you mean it?

Ritsu:
Uh...
Hey, what do you think about the lyrics, Mugi?
She's totally enchanted!
Mugi, you aren't seriously telling me that you like them.

Tsumugi:
I do...

Ritsu:
Uh, you think these lyrics work?

Tsumugi:
I do...

Ritsu:
Seriously?

Tsumugi:
Je nais. (?)

Ritsu:
For real?

Tsumugi:
Yes, bring it on.

Ritsu:
Uh... S-Sawako!

Sawako:
"Sawako"?

Ritsu:
You think these lyrics are unworkable, right?

Sawako:
Why, yes! I suppose they're not!

Ritsu:
See, I'm right.
Come on, you three, let's rethink our approach, okay? Let's take a deep breath and...

Sawako:
Wait a minute... Maybe I can give my image a boost by saying I like this perky, sappy crap.

Mio:
--You're young at heart, Ms. Yamanaka!

Tsumugi:
--That's our Ms. Yamanaka!

Yui:
--It's Ms. Yamanaka or no one!

Students:
--Ya-ma-na-ka! Woo! Ya-ma-na-ka! Woo! Ya-ma-na-ka! Woo! Ya-ma-na-ka!

Sawako:
You know, now that I think about it, I guess I really like those lyrics, too!

Ritsu:
Say what?!

Ritsu:
Well, I suppose we're going with these lyrics, then.

Yui & Tsumugi:
Yay!

Yui:
Isn't this wonderful, Mio-chan?

Mio:
Um, yeah...

Ritsu:
That means, we'll be going with Mio on vocals.

Mio:
Huh? N-no, I couldn't!

Ritsu:
Why not?

Mio:
Uh. Well, I... because I... Because I can't sing such embarrassing lyrics, that's why!

Ritsu:
Hey, you wrote 'em, lady!

Sawako:
This is gonna be a problem.

Ritsu:
Well, I guess that leaves us with...

Yui:
Uh...

Ritsu:
Mugi, want to try?

Tsumugi:
I would, but I already have my hands full just managing the keyboard.

Ritsu:
Ah, okay, then...

Yui:
hehe.

Ritsu:
I guess not.

Yui:
Ahem.

Ritsu:
Yui, you wanna try?

Yui:
Wha..!? You're asking me?! Well, but I'm not really a good singer, you know, so I don't know if I'd be the best choice for us, so I'm not sure if I should even try to do it...

Ritsu:
Never mind, then.

Yui:
I'm sorry, I lied! I'll sing! I want to sing! You gotta let me try it!

Ritsu:
Okay then, sing something.

Yui:
Roger!
♪ 君を見てるといつもハート... (Whenever I look at you, my heart...)

Ritsu:
Hold it, hold it! You'll have to sing while you're playing the guitar!

Yui:
Oh yeah, you're right. I totally forgot.

Mio:
Oh, geez...

Yui:
Okay...

Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
This time she's forgetting to sing when she plays!

Yui:
I can't sing and play guitar at the same time! I can't...

Sawako:
I guess I have no choice. I'll have to give you special training.

Yui:
Really?

Sawako:
First thing I'm gonna show you is how to Hendrix...

Yui:
That's all right.

Mio:
Huh?

Sawako:
Okay, do your best and try to keep up with me!

Yui:
Roger!

Mio:
Ritsu...

Ritsu:
What is it?

Mio:
You don't think that Mugi has a thing for Ms. Yamanaka, do you?

Ritsu:
Come again?

Mio:
What I'm trying to ask is, think she's got a crush on her?

Ritsu:
What, seriously?
Mugi! I was wondering, do you like Ms. Yamanaka?

Mio:
Hey, Ritsu! You moron!

Tsumugi:
Huh?
Oh, no. I was just... I was thinking how nice it is when it's just girls hanging out.

Ritsu:
What? No way!?

Mio:
Oh well, good for you.

Ritsu:
Wait, so you're okay with it?

Tsumugi:
If the people involved are happy, that's all that really matters, right?

Mio:
Well, um...

Ritsu:
Uh... What are we talking about here?

Nodoka:
All right, then. Yui will be providing vocals, and the set list will be "Fuwa Fuwa Time." Okay, I'll get in touch with you again once your time slot has been assigned.

Tsumugi:
Thank goodness and thank you for coming here in person to tell us.

Nodoka:
It's all part of a student council member's duties. But are you really sure you want to go with Yui on the vocals?

Ritsu:
She's been getting intensive lessons from Ms. Yamanaka after school since last week.

Mio:
We think that she'll have her whipped into shape in time.

Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi & Nodoka:
Ah!

Sawako:
Sorry to keep you waiting.
She's perfect.
Now, Yui-girl, show 'em what you've got!

Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi & Nodoka:
Oh!

Ritsu:
She's awesome!

Mio:
She's a lot of better!

Tsumugi:
Her face is full of confidence!

Yui:
♪ 君を見てるといつもハートドキドキ... (Whenever I look at you, my heart pounds like crazy...)

Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Argh!

Sawako:
I made her practice too much!

Yui:
I threw my voice out!

Ritsu:
Knock off the cutesy act!

Tsumugi:
You're kidding... Who will do the vocals, then?

Nodoka:
All changes must be in by the end of the day.

Ritsu:
What, you're not serious? Hm... In that case...
Mm... Mm...

Mio:
Hm? Hm? Huh?

Ritsu:
You're right. Mio is the only other person who knows the lyrics.

Ritsu:
Yeah, 'cause she's the one who came up with them.

Tsumugi:
I know you can do it, Mio.

Yui:
Do it for Husky-Voiced-Yui!

Mio:
Ah! Ugh!

Ritsu:
Whoa, Mio!

Tsumugi:
Mio, what's the matter?!

Ritsu:
Pull yourself together!

Yui:
There's only three days 'til we go on!

Mio:
Ritsu, don't you think we should get some practice in before we go on?

Ritsu:
Sorry, but I can't right now.

Nodoka:
Well, you still have a fair amount of time until then. Don't you want to use the time to practice?

Ritsu:
She's right! Let's practice! Pretend that didn't happen. That didn't happen.

Mio:
Today's the day of the performance! Let's try and practice as much as we can!

Tsumugi:
Let's practice!

Ritsu:
We're gonna practice, huh?
Ritsu:
One, two, three, four! One, two!

Opening Song
Cagayake!GIRLS by 放課後ティータイム(After School Tea Time)

Mio:
Today is the big day... I wonder if Yui and the others are here already?
Sorry I'm...

Yui:
Step right up, step right up! It's a bargain, it's a bargain!

Mio:
Wait, that voice...

Yui:
Righ, serving for one. Enjoy! Thanks, young lady.

Girl:
Thanks!

Mio:
Geez, Yui! What are you doing?

Yui:
Mio! Want some yakisoba? It'll be just a minute!

Mio:
Why is this happening? We perform today. We don't have time to mess around. We have to get together and practice like crazy!

Yui:
Sorry. I really want to practice, too. But I got put on the morning shift at my class' booth that I have to stay.

Mio:
Uhh..

Girl:
Thank you very much!

Girl:
Looks like we tripped the breaker.

Girl:
Aw, again?

Girl:
Hey, it'll be undercooked!

Girl:
How many times has this happened today already?

Girl:
Hey, come on! You're not supposed to have more than three hot plates at a time. You know the rules?

Girl:
It's not us! I bet you anything it's Class 5!

Mio:
Seems like a rough gig here...

Ritsu:
Thank you, come again!
Hey, Mio.

Mio:
Ritsu, do you want to try and get in some practice before our show today?

Ritsu:
Oh, now's no good for me! Just take a look at the line I've still got waiting back there.

Mio:
Well, isn't there anyone here who can take over for you?

Ritsu:
Not really. You see, I was the one who suggested doing this haunted house, so I have to oversee at lease the first few hours here.

Mio:
Ah. Well, where's Mugi then?

Ritsu:
Mm.
Hm. Thank you so much! Hope you enjoyed it!
Right, next in line, please!

Girl:
It looks scary...

Guy:
It'll be fun! Don't worry!

Mio:
In here?

Ritsu:
Yep. It's okay for class members to go in. It's dark, so watch your step.
Heh, heh, heh!

Mio:
M-Mugi, you in here?
Ahh!
M-Mugi, w-where are you?

Tsumugi:
Mio, it's me.

Mio:
Mugi!
Ahhh!

Yui:
Thanks, hope you enjoy it!
Nodoka-chan!

Nodoka:
Your voice is still scratchy. You gonna be all right?

Yui:
It's still a little bit sore from club practice, that's all. I'm gonna be just fine.

Nodoka:
Isn't today your first performance? You go on at three, right?

Yui:
Yeah.

Nodoka:
Well, you still have a fair amount of time until then. Don't you want to go and get in some practice?

Yui:
Yeah. I'm planing to do that as soon as I get finished with my shift.

Nodoka:
In that case, go ahead and take off. I'll ask around and see if there's someone who can take over the rest of your shift for you.

Yui:
Okay, but...

Nodoka:
You just go on ahead. I'll take care of it.

Girl:
Yui.

Yui:
Huh?

Girl:
What are you waiting for?

Girl:
Go practice!

Yui:
Thanks! I'll be back! Oops! Sorry about that, sonny!

Ritsu:
Go on in! Enjoy yourselves!

Yui:
Ritchan!

Ritsu:
Hey!

Yui:
Where are Mio and Mugi?

Ritsu:
Your voice hasn't come back yet, huh?

Yui:
No, I'm afraid it still sounds a little raspy.

Ritsu:
Try saying something like, "Thank you for the grub"!

Yui:
Thank you for the grub!

Ritsu:
Ha! You sound like a sumo wrestler!

Yui:
Treat a training match as a tournament, and a tournament as if it were a training match!

Ritsu:
Sumo is not a national sport, it is a martial art!

Yui:
Is this what it means to be defeated in the ring, but victorious in technique?

Ritsu:
Dosukoi, Dosukoi, Dosukoi!

Yui:
Dosukoi! Dosukoi!
Oh! So where's Mio-chan and Mugi-chan?

Ritsu:
Sorry, I couldn't resist! Mugi is working inside here, but Mio might have gone on up to the club room.

Yui:
C'mon, we gotta get in some practice!

Ritsu:
You're right, we should. Mugi and and I are gonna be relieved soon, so we'll meet upstairs just as soon as we can.

Yui:
Got it.

Ritsu:
We're gonna practice, huh? Hm...
Next in line, step right up!

Ritsu:
What're you doing, Yui?

Yui:
Shhh!

Ritsu:
Wow. I bet she's been practicing up here all morning.

Tsumugi:
Yes.

Ritsu:
Sorry to keep you waiting, Mio!

Tsumugi:
We're sorry we left you by yourself.

Yui:
Yeah, we all wanna practice, too!

Mio:
You guys...
What kept you?!

Ritsu:
Yeah, all right! That didn't sound too bad at all.

Tsumugi:
Oh, yes. That was perfect.

Yui:
You think you can do this, Mio-chan?

Mio:
Hm... Mm-hmm.

Tsumugi:
We'll play it just like that.

Sawako:
I knew I'd find you here!

Yui:
Is there a problem, Ms. Yamanaka?

Sawako:
Although it wasn't voluntary, I am your club's adviser. So I thought I ought to do something to help you out. I made costumes for each of you!

Ritsu:
You're way too into this!
Ms. Yamanaka, we appreciate the sentiment and all.

Mio:
You expect me to put that on and sing? In front of the whole school?

Ritsu:
But not the best timing.

Sawako:
I don't understand. Are you telling me that you don't care for them.
If you want, you can always wear my old costume!

Mio:
Ah! I certainly feel like that last outfit wasn't so bad!

Ritsu:
Stop it, Ms. Yamanaka! Mio isn't the only one who'd be embarrassed to wear this stuff.

Mio:
That's right!

Sawako:
Gosh, you really mean that? But I worked so hard on making them. And besides... Yui-chan and Mugi-chan are only too happy to wear theirs.

Ritsu:
Ugh! Would you two cut it out!

Mio:
Why is all of this happening?

Sawako:
You're not still nervous, are you? How about I give you a makeup job so insane no one will know it's you?!

Mio:
No-no-no, thank you!

Sawako:
Right! You go and break a leg out there, girls!

Yui:
Ahh! Oh, no! All this craziness has made me forget everything I'm supposed to do!

Tsumugi:
Let's practice then! It's the only real cure!

Ritsu:
She's right, let's practice! Pretend that didn't happen... That didn't happen...

Mio:
He he he...

Part B
Ritsu:
Okay, go ahead and carry this down to the auditorium.

Yui:
Okay. Whoa!

Ritsu:
It's pretty heavy, so be careful.

Yui:
Hey, by the way, how's Mio-chan doing?

Ritsu:
Well, I'm having Mio focus on something else.

Mio:
I'm on vocals... In front of the whole school... Ow...

Ritsu:
That's obviously what will happen. It's just way too risky to have her move any equipment around.

Yui:
Oh yeah, I see...

Yui:
There's not a bead of sweat on her!

Yui:
Nodoka-chan...

Nodoka:
Ah, Yui. The play is just getting started now, so leave that in the corner, okay?

Yui:
Gotcha...
Whew...

Nodoka:
All right, the Choir Club is up next, and the Light Music Club is after that. And all their equipment is here.

Yui:
It's almost time!

Yui:
Ah... We're finally done moving it all!

Ritsu:
Yeah, good work.

Tsumugi:
Tea's ready! Come on and get it, you two!

Yui:
Yay! That's our Mugi-chan!

Yui:
Ritchan, you and Mio are childhood friends, aren't you?

Ritsu:
Yeah, that's right.

Yui:
For how long would you say?

Ritsu:
We've been joined at the hip since kindergarten! Uh... No, wait. Maybe it was since grade school?

Yui:
Then you're not really childhood friends. Now, has Mio-chan always been the shy type ever since she was just a little girl?

Ritsu:
You'd better believe it. There was one time...

Young Ritsu:
--Oh my, you got really pretty hair!

Ritsu:
When I said to her...

Young Ritsu:
--Oh, wow! You're left-handed!
--That's really cool! Everybody, Mio-chan's so awesome!

Ritsu:
When I said stuff like that, she'd go totally beet-red and get all frustrated and embarrassed!

Yui:
Well, that was your fault the way she is, Ritchan!

Mio:
Has all the equipment been carried over?

Yui:
Mio-chan!

Ritsu:
You... got your nerves under control?

Mio:
Hm?

Tsumugi:
Here you are.

Ritsu:
Surprising, considering how you were against doing vocals.

Mio:
Get real. I'm not a baby, you know.
I can't let myself freak out over every little thing forever.

Yui & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Oh yeah. She's totally freaking out!

Ritsu:
We're about to go on in a few minutes! How are you gonna perform in your condition?

Mio:
I can't do it. Oh, Ritsu, please do the vocals for me!

Ritsu:
If I did that, who would play the drums then?

Mio:
I'll play them, please!

Ritsu:
Then who's supposed to play the bass?!

Mio:
I'll play the bass, too, please!

Ritsu:
Have it your way! I'd love to see how you're gonna pull that off!

Mio:
Ritsu! Ritsu!

Ritsu:
Would you please get off me, Mio?!

Mio:
Ritsu! Ritsu! Ritsu!

Yui:
This is all my fault. I'm sorry, Mio-chan.
If I hadn't overdone it and did this to my voice, you wouldn't have to go up on stage and sing today.

Mio:
Yui...

Yui:
Hm! Don't worry, I'll handle the vocals, okay?!

Ritsu:
No, no, no, no...

Mio:
Yui, I'm sorry. That's not what I wanted, you know that?!

Ritsu:
Hm. Oh, that's right! We need to come up with a spiel![1]

Yui:
What is a spiel?

Ritsu:
Hm? Intros and stuff! You know, like when the band banters with the crowd between songs at a concert.

Yui:
Oh, right, right!

Ritsu:
Hey, everybody! How are you doing?!
The Light Music Club would like to welcome each and every one of you to our very first show ever today!

Yui:
Haha! Woo! Woo!

Ritsu:
Now, let's introduce our members!
Guitar! You can always find her slacking off on her days off. "If it's sweet, leave it to me!" she always says. It's the devil-may-care fairy, Yui!
And on keyboard! She's your girl when it comes to fine snack goods! She has the graceful, lively, natural airhead of a rich girl, give a big hand to Mugi!
And on bass and vocals! Scary and gory stories are most definitely not her thing! She is the Don of the Light Music Club, the dangerous queen, it's Mio!
Ow!

Mio:
Who are you calling dangerous, huh?!

Ritsu:
You just proved my point...
And last but not least, me! Fair of face and figure, and mind! She's everybody's idol with her sunny smile. Give a big hand to me, Ritsu!
Ow!

Mio:
Quit tooting your own horn!

Announcer:
Let's hear it for the Choir Club.

Yui:
Ah! Look at all those people out there!

Tsumugi:
Goodness, you're right.

Yui:
Our very first number...

Ritsu:
Come on! Time to get out there and show them what we practiced!

Yui:
Yes!

Tsumugi:
Mm!

Mio:
Um, Ritsu... Do I really have to go out on stage looking like this?

Ritsu:
I think it suits you really well, Mio.

Yui:
She's right! It looks so cute on you!

Mio:
Oh, man!

Announcer:
Next up is a performance by the Light Music Club! So get ready for some great music!

Ritsu:
All right now, let's do it!

Yui & Mio & Tsumugi:
Yeah!

Yui
Whoa!

Nodoka:
You can do it, Yui!

Girl:
What's with the costumes?

Girl:
They're so cute!

Girl:
What club are they again?

Sawako:
I nailed it!

Mio:
I can't do this!

Yui:
Mio-chan!

Mio:
Huh?

Yui:
We all know that you practiced and practiced and practiced your heart out for this, Mio-chan.

Ritsu:
Yeah, Mio!

Tsumugi:
We know, Mio!

Yui:
We know you can do this! So, let's knock 'em dead!

Ritsu:
One, two, three, four! One, two, three!

Mio:
Thank you! Everyone!

Ritsu:
I think maybe this will finally let Mio get over her shyness.

Mio:
Uh... Ah! Oh!

Ritsu:
Mio!

Mio:
Ugh... Ow...
Huh?

Ritsu:
That was some great work yesterday, everyone!

Yui & Tsumugi & Sawako:
Yeah, really good work!

Ritsu:
For your first time in front of a crowd, I think you did pretty good, Yui!

Yui:
Aw!

Ritsu:
As for Mio... She's apparently got her very own fan club now!

Tsumugi:
Oh, amazing!

Ritsu:
But I'm afraid she's kinda out of commission at the moment.

Yui:
Huh?

Mio:
Pa... Pa-panties... Panties... No one will ever want to marry me now...

Ritsu:
I made a flyer for our Christmas party!

Mio:
Ah!

Tsumugi:
I wanted this instead, so I asked them to exchange it.

Ui:
Now then, what should I make?

Young Yui:
All done!
Gee, I wonder if Santa's gonna come this year.
I haven't been very good so I'm afraid maybe he won't come. May I get presents!
Young Yui:
Okay... A little further...

Young Ui:
S-Sis, are you sure can do this?

Young Yui:
I can do it!
All done!
Gee, I wonder if Santa's gonna come this year.
I forget to do my homework and wouldn't finish my lunch sometimes... I haven't been very good, so I'm afraid maybe he won't come. May I get presents.

Young Ui:
Oh, it'll be okay, Sis! I know it! Santa will bring you lots and lots of presents, you'll see.

Young Yui:
I think you should try making a wish, too, Ui!

Young Ui:
Hm... May there be a White Christmas this year.

Young Yui:
Um, what's a White Christmas?

Young Ui:
It's a Christmas morning when snow has fallen and made everything really pretty and white!

Young Yui:
Oh...

Young Yui:
Ui! Ui! Hurry! Hurry!

Young Ui:
Sis, wait up!

Young Yui:
Ta-dah!

Young Ui:
Huh?

Young Yui:
It's a White Christmas!

Young Ui:
Uh? Huh? Big Sis, what is this?

Young Yui:
It's stuffing from a cushion!

Ui:
Our parents scolded Sis really badly that day.

Yui:
Uh? Ui, what's so funny?

Ui:
I really hope we'll have another fun Christmas together this year.

Ui:
It sure has gotten cold.

Yui:
Ui, shouldn't you be wearing your scarf?

Ui:
Mm-hmm, but I guess it blew away when I washed it and hung it out to dry last year.

Yui:
Oh!

Ui:
Thank you, Big Sis.

Yui:
Nice 'n warm, nice 'n warm.

Ui:
Hey, what happened to your other mitten?

Yui:
Oh, I lost it somewhere.
Oh! Nice 'n warm, nice 'n warm.

Ritsu:
Check it out! I made a flyer for our Christmas party!

Mio:
Huh?
We decided that we're gonna have a Christmas party?

Ritsu:
I did. But I didn't tell anyone.

Mio:
You should have!
"The date: December 24th, Christmas Eve. The place: Mugi's house. Cover charge: ten dollars." Huh?

Tsumugi:
Sorry, that really isn't a good day for our house.

Ritsu:
Yeah, I was kind of afraid of that.

Tsumugi:
The schedule at our house is always packed this time of year. You have to make arrangements at least a full month in advance. I'm truly sorry!

Mio:
R-really you don't say.

Yui & Mio:
That's some house.

Tsumugi:
Ritsu, what about your house?

Mio:
No. No, forget that. Ritsu's place is so messy there's nowhere for you to stand.

Ritsu:
Excuse me?!
You're one to talk. Your room has dirty clothes tossed everywhere. Even panties.

Mio:
Aah! Hey! Don't make up garbage about me!

Ritsu:
I have plenty of pictures as proof.

Mio:
You big liar!

Ritsu:
It's the absolute truth!

Mio:
Pan pastries... Pun-tease?!

Yui & Mio & Tsumugi:
Ugh...

Ritsu:
More where that came from!

Mio:
Aah! Stop it! Please, stop it!

Tsumugi:
Hey, Yui, how about your house?

Yui:
I don't see why not.

Ritsu:
Yeah! Score!

Mio:
But are you sure it'll be okay for a big group to come over on Christmas Eve?

Yui:
Mm-hm. Mom and Dad are both gonna be away on vacation that day.

Ritsu:
Hey, they were gone when we were there last time, too.

Yui:
Yeah, they like to travel a lot together. They said they're going to Germany this year.

Yui's parents:
--Ahahahahaha, ahahahaha. Whee!

Mio:
What a lovey-dovey couple!

Tsumugi:
Is there anything that the three of us can bring?

Yui:
Just leave all the food to me!

Ritsu:
Are you sure about that?

Yui:
Yeah! No problem! 'Cause Ui will be making at all.

Mio:
Good thing she has such a mature sister...

Ritsu:
Oh, that's right! There's one more thing! Let's have a present exchange!

Yui:
Yeah! Let's do it!

Tsumugi:
Great idea!

Ritsu:
Don't bring anything weird, Mio, okay?

Mio:
Huh? That's what you do. Like that time back in grade school...

Yui:
One-trick pony.

Ritsu:
Oh!? What, are you some kind of comedian?

Yui:
No. Are you?

Tsumugi:
I can't wait! Christmas party.

Ritsu:
Do you wanna come to the Light Music Club Christmas party, Nodoka?

Nodoka:
Uh, are you sure? I'm not a club member.

Ritsu:
Don't worry. It's fine. I mean we're all friends here, after all.
The more people that come to the party, the more money we'll have to spend.

Mio:
What are you planning on doing with it?

Yui:
Can you come, Nodoka-chan?

Nodoka:
Mm-hm.

Yui:
Yay!

Yui:
So that's the whole deal. I hope we can count on you. Of course, I'll be chipping in and help out.

Ui:
Just leave everything to me!
But, uh... If she hurt herself helping me, that would be terrible.
Mm... I would like you to handle the decorations, please.

Yui:
Roger that, ma'am!

Ui:
What are you gonna do at your Christmas party, anyway?

Yui:
Eat cake, trade presents. You know, all like Christmassy kind of stuff. Oh! Also each of us will do a party trick!

Ui:
Party tricks, huh? I wonder what I should do?

Yui:
Oh wow, you're really giving it a lot of thought.

Ui:
Don't worry, I'm sure I'll think of something!

Yui:
Uh... Mm-hm.

Ui:
And I'm gonna have to go out and get a present, too.

Yui:
Oh, you're right. I'll have to go buy one, too!

Yui:
What do you think would be good? Ah!

Nodoka:
Hm?

Yui:
This is so cute! Oh, Nodoka-chan, I really, really want this!

Nodoka:
You know, normally you have to go again if you draw your own name.

Yui:
Aw... Guess I'll go with this, then.

Nodoka:
Uh...

Mio:
Ritsu, made up your mind yet?

Ritsu:
How's this?

Mio:
Ah! A-absolutely not!

Ritsu:
How about this, then?

Mio:
Ah!

Ritsu:
Or how about thi... Ow!

Mio:
Why do you always try to get stuff like that?!

Yui:
Yes, I finally decided!

Ritsu:
Oh, hey, you guys! You came to do a little gift shopping, too, huh?

Yui:
So, what did you buy?

Mio:
Well, if we told you that, it would just spoil all the fun.

Yui:
Guess you're right.

Ritsu:
Oh, hey! Ta-da, ta-da, ta-dah! We're on our way over to the raffle drawing!

Yui:
Really? So are we!

Ritsu:
Come to Mama!
I won more tissues?

Woman:
We have a winner! Our top prize!
Here you go. Congratulations!

Yui:
Mugi-chan?

Tsumugi:
You're all out shopping, too?

Ritsu:
Did you just win?

Tsumugi:
Mm-hm. A trip to Hawaii, I think.

Mio:
What is it with her amazing luck?!

Tsumugi:
But I turned the prize down.

Ritsu:
Why?!

Tsumugi:
I wanted this instead. So I asked them to exchange it. We should all play it together on Christmas.

Yui & Mio & Tsumugi & Nodoka:
Mm-hm.

Ui:
Now then, what should I make? Uh, Hmm... And what trick should I do?

Part B
Yui:
Ah!

Ui:
Uh. Big Sis! What happened here?

Yui:
Oh, Ui...

Ui:
Uh... I thought you were cleaning the place up.

Yui:
I couldn't help myself.
Oh! Ooo... Those look delicious!

Ui:
Huh? Hey, don't eat those, Big Sis.

Yui:
Don't worry. I won't sneak any bites!
Hehehe...
I said I wouldn't!

Ui:
It's like we're playing Red Light, Green Light or something.[1]
Come on, Sis, stop fooling around.

Yui:
Hehehe...

Ui:
You haven't done any decorating at all yet, so you'd better hurry.

Yui:
Snip, snip!

Ui:
You mean you're just getting started?!
Uh!

Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Merry Christmas!

Ui:
Come in!

Ritsu:
Hey-yo! Yui, we're here!

Yui:
Hey, everybody! Come on in!

Ritsu:
What're you doing?

Yui:
I couldn't bring myself to stop once I got started.

Ritsu:
What are you, a grade schooler?

Ui:
Oh, here, let me take your coats.

Ritsu:
Oh, right. Thanks a lot, Ui.

Mio:
A hard working little sister, and a goofball big sister... It's the perfect setup for a sad soap opera.

Ritsu:
Wow, this food is amazing!

Tsumugi:
You made all this, Ui-chan?

Yui:
Don't be rude! I made some, too! Look at this cake!

Ritsu:
That's awesome!

Yui:
I put all the strawberries on top!

Ritsu:
Hey, return the "Awesome!" I just said!

Yui:
Not right?

Ui:
Um, well, Big Sis worked really hard on all sort of things today. For instance, she tried to clean the house and tried to put up the decorations. And she... uh, uh...

Mio:
She's really trying to stand up for her.

Ritsu:
We get it. We're sorry.

Yui:
Nodoka-chan says that she's going to be late, so let's go ahead and have a toast!

Ui:
Mm-hm.

Mio:
The airhead older sister and the admirable little sister...

Ritsu:
I suppose that's gotta make for a pretty good team.

Yui & Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi & Nodoka & Ui & Sawako:
Cheers!

Ritsu:
Oh, wow, that's yet another year done and gone!

Sawako:
Sheesh, you sound like an old man.

Ritsu:
Ah! Ms. Yamanaka?!

Sawako:
These are delicious. Can I have another helping?

Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi & Nodoka:
When did she get here?!

Ritsu:
Don't tell me she climbed in with a rope!

Mio:
And then she snuck in...

Ritsu:
...through an open window?!

Sawako:
Now really, who do you I am, anyway? Honestly, what sort of club forgets to invite their faculty advisor?

Ritsu:
Um, well, "forget" isn't exactly what I'd call it...

Yui:
We didn't ask you because we assumed you had plans with your boyfriend.

Sawako:
Wha-! How dare you say that! How dare you say that! How dare you say that!

Ritsu:
Clueless types are scary.

Sawako:
For punishment, I want you to change into this, Yui.

Yui:
Why in the world would you bring something like that with you?
Ta-dah!

Sawako:
Not working. You're just not feeling quite enough shame.
Yes, this calls for...

Mio:
Ah!

Sawako:
There's no escape!

Mio:
Ahhh!

Sawako:
Come back here!

Mio:
No!

Nodoka:
Hello?

Sawako:
Quit your struggling!

Nodoka:
I'm sorry. I have the wrong house.

Mio:
It's the right house! Help me!

Mio:
No one will ever want to marry me now...

Ui:
High schoolers sure lead amazing lives.

Ritsu:
To get this party back on track, I think we should have our gift exchange!

Yui:
Yeah!

Ui:
High schoolers change moods at the drop of a hat!

Nodoka:
Uh... But what about you, Ma'am?

Sawako:
Oh, don't worry. I brought something, too.

Yui & Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi & Ui & Nodoka:
Oh!

Sawako:
To be honest, I had planned to give this present to my boyfriend today, if we were still together.

Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi & Nodoka:
Way to drag us down...

Sawako:
All right, then, let's get started, guys!

Ritsu:
Uh, sure...

Sawako:
Hm.

Yui & Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi & Ui & Nodoka:
Uh...

Sawako:
The one you have when the song ends is yours.
Here.
Jingle bells! Here! Jingle bells! Here you go! Jingle all the way...

Ritsu:
It's like she's losing it.

Yui:
Aren't Christmas gift exchanges supposed to be more fun than this?

Mio:
No one will ever wanna marry me...

Sawako:
Hehe! Jingle bells! Jingle bells! Jingle all the way!

Ui:
I'm getting dizzy...

Tsumugi:
This may be the most exciting Christmas I've ever had!

Sawako:
That's all!

Ritsu:
Um, this is the one that I brought to the party.

Sawako:
Oh, no problem. We'll trade!

Mio:
Uh. Ms. Yamanaka!

Sawako:
Something is telling me that whatever is inside here is amazing! Let's see what we have!

Yui & Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi & Ui & Nodoka:
Uh...

Sawako:
Oh, yeah! This is the best Christmas I've ever had!

Ritsu:
She's gone crazy!

Nodoka:
Stay calm, everyone.

Ritsu:
I'm sorry. I'll never do it again!

Yui:
I'm sure something good is in store for you!

Mio:
Oh, that's the present that I brought to the party.

Nodoka:
Ah... That's from me.

Yui:
Nodoka, it's Christmas, not year-end.
Ah! These look tasty. You're so lucky.

Mio:
Ahh!

Sawako:
Oh yes, that's the one that I brought.

Yui:
Wait a minute! You were going to give that to your boyfriend for Christmas?

Sawako:
I was! So pardon me for breathing!

Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi & Nodoka:
Uh...

Mio:
Clueless types are scary...

Tsumugi:
I think, the only ones who haven't opened their presents are Yui-chan and Ui-chan right?

Sawako:
Would you hurry up and open them!

Yui & Ui:
Y-yes, ma'am!

Yui:
Oh. I got that because you lost your scarf!

Ui:
Oh. I got that because I remembered that you lost your mitten!

Mio:
I'm just wondering what are you two would have done if you hadn't ended up with each other's presents?

Tsumugi:
So sweet!

Yui:
Thank you, Ui!

Ui:
Mm! And thank you very much, Big Sis. Winter will seem almost warm when I wear it.

Ritsu:
Right! Now it's time for each of us to do a party trick!

Mio:
Way to ruin a perfectly good moment, Ritsu...

Ritsu:
Hmm? Hey, you wanna go first, Mio?

Mio:
Ah!

Nodoka:
Wow. She's pretty old school!

Ritsu:
Yui, then!

Yui:
Who, me? I'm not... Uh...

Ui:
I'll go! I'd like to go first!

Yui:
What? Really?

Ui:
Hello, everyone! Merry Christmas! Is everyone having a good time?
I'm sorry, this is all that I can do.

Ritsu:
Did you practice?

Ui:
I did! Big Sis said that we would be having a talent contest today.

Yui:
Huh? You thought I was serious?

Ui:
You mean you weren't?

Yui:
I'm sorry, Ui...

Ui:
D'okay, don't worry about it.

Yui:
Now I'll go!
Air guitar!

Ritsu:
Yeah! Then I'll play air drums!

Yui:
Mio-chan really pushed herself.

Tsumugi:
I'll do an impression!

Ritsu:
W-what's that?

Tsumugi:
My impression of a sunfish!

Sawako:
Okay, now, I'm going next!
A maple leaf!

Nodoka:
Who is this women, and what did she do with my sweet Ms. Yamanaka?

Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi & Nodoka & Sawako:
Thank you for having us over!

Yui:
Boy, it sure is cold, Ui...

Ui:
Look! It's snow!

Yui:
Wow, you're right! It looks like we're going to have a White Christmas!

Ui:
You know, Sis, you once gave me a White Christmas as a present and I loved it, remember?

Yui:
Huh? Huh...

Ui:
Today sure was fun...

Yui:
Ui? Ui, can I come in?

Ui:
Big Sis?

Yui:
You mind if I sleep with you?

Ui:
Mm-hmm.

Yui:
I'm gonna wear these to bed tonight! 'Cause they're so warm.

Ui:
Then maybe I'll wear my brand new scarf to bed. 'Cause it's warm, too.

Ui:
Ah-choo!
Uh... Come on, Big Sis, I'm freezing!

Ui:
Hey, I'm gonna start dusting, Big Sis. You wanna help?

Ui:
Here's your New Year's Eve noodles!

Yui:
Oh!

Ui:
You said two mochi with your soup, right?

Yui:
Uh-huh.

Ui:
I peeled some tangerines.

Ui:
Ahh...

Yui:
And that's how I spent my holiday.

Ritsu:
Give me Ui-chan!

Tsumugi:
Those two are quite a pair, aren't they?

Ritsu:
But won't you get fat, doing nothing but eating and sleeping?

Yui:
Oh, no. I never, ever gain weight, no matter how much I eat.

Mio:
No way!

Tsumugi:
That can't be!

Yui:
You, too, Mugi-chan?

Mio:
Mugi, how much weight did you put on?

Tsumugi:
...pounds.

Mio:
I gained ...pounds.

Ritsu:
Just to be safe, you should apologize.

Yui:
I'm so sorry! Mio-chan, you dressed up really nice today!

Mio:
Just 'cause Ritsu asked me if I was going to.

Ritsu:
I was just asking!

Mio:
Wh-what?!

Yui:
I guess things won't be much different this year, huh, Mio-chan?

Mio:
I'm gonna go change!

Yui:
Wait! You should keep them on! You look cute!

Mio:
Uh, think so?

Yui:
I sure do!

Tsumugi:
Oh, Now I've seen something amazing this year, too!

Ritsu:
You haven't changed one bit, either.

Sawako:
Ugh!

Ritsu:
Ms. Yamanaka?!

Girl:
Wow, look at this!

Ritsu:
Looks like she hasn't changed, either.

Ritsu:
So, what did you guys pray for?

Tsumugi:
For my family's health and safety.

Mio:
I asked for help loosing weight.

Yui:
I asked to be able to eat lots and lots of yummy food!

Ritsu:
Hey, we should all pray for the Light Music Club, too.

Mio:
May we all get better at playing our music.

Tsumugi:
May we all continue to have lots of fun together.

Yui:
May we all be able to eat lots of the great cakes that Mugi-chan brings to the... Ow!
May I become more proficient at the guitar...

Ritsu:
Right!

Yui:
Want to grab something to eat on the way home?

Tsumugi:
Please don't talk about food!

Mio:
You really never gain any weight, Yui?

Welcome to our club room!

Ritsu:
Come in, come in, it's so good to see you! Welcome to our club!

Ui:
Uh, uh... First, could you explain what that was?

In any event, we'll be performing four songs tomorrow. So, be sure to come.

Ui:
Hello, I'm Ui Hirasawa.
My high school entrance exams are over, and this spring, I will be joining my sister Yui at...

Yui:
Ui!

Ui:
Uh?

Yui:
W-was your name there?

Ui:
What's the matter with you, Sis? Why are you so nervous?

Yui:
Because...

Ui:
My name was there. I passed, Sis.

Yui:
Really?!

Ui:
Mm-hmm.

Yui:
Oh...

Ui:
Uh, Sis? I really can't breathe...

Yui:
You did so good! You did great!
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you so much! Thank you! It was thanks to the kind support of each and every one of you here today that Ui managed to pass and begin her journey to a happy and successful life!

Tsumugi:
Well, it looks like Ui passed.

Mio:
Looks like Yui is the happier of the two.

Ritsu:
A doting parent? Or a doting sister, is more like it.

Ui:
It sure is shaping up to be a happy spring.

Tsumugi:
Congratulations, Ui!

Ritsu:
Yeah, way to go!

Ui:
Thank you. Thank you, everybody.

Uh... There it is.

Yui:
And... there I am! Second year, Class 2, huh?

Yeah, so am I.

Tsumugi:
Oh, look! So am I! Class 2!

Yui:
Really? No way! That's great! How about you, Mio?

Yui & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Uh... um...

Mio:
Hey! What's with those looks?

Ritsu:
If you ever get lonely, come over to visit whenever you want!

Mio:
What am I, a grade schooler? Are you gonna be okay away from me, huh? You won't be able to crib off my homework!

Ritsu:
Ha! You don't have to worry about me! I'll have Mugi with me to help me out.

Mio:
Hm!

Ui:
Hello, everyone! A very good morning!

Ritsu:
Oh! The uniform looks great on you!

Tsumugi:
You look so innocent!

Ui:
Y-you really think so?

Ui:
Uh. Sis, your collar!
You left the tag from the dry-cleaner on.

Yui:
Oh. Wow, you're right!

Ui:
And also, you've got a bad case of bed head.

Yui:
I didn't have time to brush it this morning!

Ui:
Let's try to get up a little earlier starting tomorrow, all right?

Yui:
Mm-hmm...

Ritsu:
You know, maybe you two would be much better off if you switched ages with each other.

Ui:
Oh. Well, see you later.

Ritsu:
I guess we should take off, too.

Yui:
Huh? Class-2 is up on the second floor?

Tsumugi:
That's right.

Ritsu:
It's like we're literally upperclassmen now. See ya around, you Year 2, Floor 1, Class 1 student you!

Mio:
Oh yeah! Bite me!

Tsumugi:
We'll see you at break!

Yui:
Where on the second floor is it?

Ritsu:
I think it's somewhere around.

Mio:
I'm lonely...

Mio:
There isn't a single girl here that I know.

Nodoka:
Mio! Glad to see you! I was worried I wouldn't know anyone when I was put in a different class than Yui. Here's hoping for a good year together.

Mio:
Same here!

Girl 4:
Want to join the Basketball Club?

Girl 5:
The Tea Ceremony Club really is a lot of fun.

Girl 6:
Consider the Occult Studies Club!

Girl 7:
Are you interested in ping pong?

Yui:
Wow, look at this, the halls are packed already!

Tsumugi:
Large clubs certainly have more recruiting options.

Ritsu:
Don't ever underestimate the Light Music Club! Mio, got the flyers?

Mio:
Well, I kinda threw this together.

Ritsu:
"Kinda" is right...

Mio:
Ah!?

Ritsu:
It lacks any selling points.

Tsumugi:
What exactly are our selling points.

Ritsu:
Something like, "Come and join the Light Music Club, where you'll get all the tea and snacks you want and get to sleep!"

Yui:
That sounds great!

Mio:
No it doesn't!

Ritsu:
Well, do you have any better ideas? 'Cause the way it is now, it's got no impact!

Sawako:
If it doesn't, we'll just give it some!

Mio:
We're the Light Music Club...

Tsumugi:
We're holding a performance to welcome new students, meow. Please be sure to come, meow.

Ritsu:
If you're interested, come to the Music Room after school. Woof, woof, woof!

Yui:
There's also lots of yummy snacks, cluck!

Yui:
Uh, Mio-chan...

Mio:
Wh-what is it?

Yui:
It's doing the opposite of what we wanted.

Mio:
Yeah, that just occurred to me, too.

Yui:
Oh, really?

You know you shouldn't run at people like that.

Yui:
Yeah I'm sorry...

Ritsu:
Oh man, these things are way too hot...

Tsumugi:
I think it's fun. Like we're working at a part-time job.

Yui:
You sure do like working Mugi-chan.

Azusa:
Uh...

Girl 9:
Come on, Azusa. Let's go.

Azusa:
Uh-huh.

Yui:
After all that sweating, we hardly had any takers.

Ritsu:
We'll just have to make up for it at tomorrow's performance!

Yui:
You're right.

Sawako:
Excuse me. But I made all these outfits for you, too.

Ritsu:
Uh, well, afternoon classes are starting.

Girl 10:
The Light Music Club?

Jun:
Yeah, all the girls came across as being pretty cool. Wanna check them out?

Girl 10:
Uh, no thanks, I'll pass. See ya.

Jun:
What's gotten into her? You'll come, right?

Ui:
Sure, I guess. I'll go with you.

Jun:
Then let's go.

Azusa:
Uh...

Girl 11:
Azusa, Jazz Appreciation is having a welcome meeting in their club room up stairs. Let's go.

Azusa:
Hm... Mm...

Ui:
Here it is.
Excuse us. May we come in?

Yui:
Welcome to our club room!

Ui:
Uh, Big Sis?!

Ritsu:
Oh, Ui!

Tsumugi:
You're joining the Light Music Club?

Ui:
Wait! You two are dressed up, too?

Mio:
Help me!

Sawako:
Step aside, please!

Ritsu:
Come in, come in. It's so good to see you. Welcome to our club!

Ui:
Uh... First, could you explain what that was?

Girl 10:
As I recall, it's supposed to be two doors down from the Occult Studies Club.

Azusa:
Huh? I wonder what's up there?

Girl 10:
I'm not exactly sure, but I think it's the Music Room.

Azusa:
The Music Room, huh?

Yui:
Ever since Christmas, it's like Ms. Yamanaka has gotten totally addicted to putting us in different costumes.

Ui:
Ah, I see.
Oh, I nearly forgot, this is Yui. She is my big sister.

Yui:
I'm Yui Hirasawa. If you wait just a minute, I'll go get you some nice, tasty tea.
It's okay to take this one, isn't it?

Tsumugi:
It's pretty hot, so be careful, okay?

Yui:
Ow!

Tsumugi:
Are you all right?

Ui:
S-Sis, are you okay?
You just have a seat, Big Sis. I'll take it from here.

Yui:
Are you sure?

Ritsu:
Oh, Yui...

Ui:
Let me introduce Ritsu.

Ritsu:
Hi there, I'm the club president, Ritsu Tainaka.

Nodoka:
Darn it, Ritsu.

Ritsu:
Hm?

Jun:
She seems really cool.

Nodoka:
You still haven't submitted your request form to use the school auditorium! If you don't, you won't be able to perform tomorrow.

Ritsu:
Oh, you're right...

Nodoka:
I swear, how many times do I have to tell you?

Ritsu:
Sorry! I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

Ui:
I want you to meet Tsumugi Kotobuki.

Tsumugi:
It's a pleasure to meet you.

Jun:
And you, too.

Tsumugi:
I'm so sorry for all the drama.

Ritsu:
Wait, wait!

Jun:
She seems like she's really nice.

Nodoka:
And what's with these silly getups, anyway?

Ritsu:
Hey, they weren't my idea!

Tsumugi:
Oh, my, Ritsu...

Ui:
Huh?

Ui:
And last but not least is... huh?
Uh...

Jun:
Her?

Ui:
Yeah, her name is Mio Akiyama. It's just that she gets embarrassed really easily.

Ritsu:
Huh? What's the deal, Mio? Quit hiding out there and come on in and join the rest of us.

Mio:
No way! You'll laugh at me!

Ui:
No, we won't laugh.
It looks great on you.

Mio:
Y-you, um... You really mean it?

Ui & Jun:
She's so cute!

Ui:
Uh?

Sawako:
Hmm... Hmm...

Jun:
Um, Ui, who's this lady?

Ui:
This is Ms. Yamanaka. She's their faculty advisor.

Sawako:
You two...

Ui & Jun:
Yes?

Sawako:
Care to try one?

Ui & Jun:
No thank you.

Girl 11:
Please consider joining us.

Azusa & Girl 10:
Thank you very much, we will.

Girl 10:
So what did you think?

Azusa:
Hmm, Well, it didn't quite seem the same as real jazz if you know what I mean.

Girl 10:
It didn't, huh?

Azusa:
Uh...

Girl 10:
Hey, why did you stop?

Azusa:
That reminds me...

Part B
Jun:
Wow, they look kinda cool!

Ui:
Now they finally look like a Light Music Club.

Yui:
Mio-chan, my strap is caught on my shoulder.

Mio:
Yeah, mine is, too.

Ritsu:
I can't move in this skirt...

Tsumugi:
Uh... Yeah, these sleeves are... No, I guess they're fine.

Ritsu:
Ah! I can't play like this!

Mio:
Whose bright idea was it to wear maid outfits?!

Tsumugi:
We decided to change into track suits.

Ritsu:
Okay, here I come!

Yui:
Ready!

Ritsu:
Yeah! Hahaha! You're next, Mugi! Go on!

Tsumugi:
Right!

Mio:
What do you think you're doing?!

Ritsu:
Okay, why don't we get started, then.

Yui:
Mm.

Jun:
That was awesome!

Ui:
They're cool, but not those track suits...

Girl 10:
You really going? They were the ones in those animal costumes, remember?

Azusa:
I'm just gonna take a quick peek.

Azusa:
Track suits?

Girl 10:
Hey, isn't that Ui Hirasawa? She's in our class.
It's almost like she doesn't want to be there...

Azusa:
Maybe they don't take things seriously in this club.

Yui:
Um, we're really sorry we didn't give you a full-on proper performance.

Mio:
We normally go all-out when we play.

Yui:
Really, we do that?

Mio:
Of course we do!

Tsumugi:
In any event, we'll be performing four songs tomorrow, so be sure to come.

Ritsu:
We'll want to hear your unvarnished opinion!

Jun:
Sure, I'll do that...

Ui:
Uh... W-well, I guess we should get going then. I'll see you later on back at home, Big Sis.

Yui:
Sure thing, Ui.

Ui:
So, what did you think?

Jun:
Um, well, they're certainly incredible in many ways.

Ui:
You think so?

Jun:
Oh, and that cake we had was really good!

Ui:
Yeah, it was, wasn't it?
Um, listen, I...

Jun:
I'm sorry, I have to go to the bathroom! Go on without me. 'Bye.

Ui:
Their prospects are looking grim...
Uh...

Azusa:
Uh.

Ui:
Hm?
Hmm...

Yui:
What did she think? What did she think?

Ui:
She said... she thought it was incredible.

Yui:
Wasn't it, though? She'll come tomorrow, too, right?

Ui:
Yeah, probably...

Yui:
The Light Music Club, it's really a blast!

Ui:
Yeah.
Hey, Big Sis?

Yui:
Yeah?

Ui:
What do you think is the best thing about the Light Music Club?

Yui:
Huh? Well, let me think a second... I guess it's how much fun it is.

Ui:
Fun in what way?

Yui:
I don't know. Fun is fun. Ah, do you wanna join, too, Ui? Our goal is to play the Budokan!

Ui:
I'll think about it.
Now that I do think about it, Sis has been really energetic ever since she joined the club. Until a little while ago, she...

Yui:
--Ui... ice cream...

Ui:
--Not until after you've had dinner!

Yui:
--I want ice cream, ice cream!

Ui:
But now, she's really focused and working hard.

Yui:
Ui?

Ui:
Yeah, Sis?

Yui:
I really wanna have ice cream.

Ui:
After you've had your dinner.
In some ways she's the same as ever, though...

Mio:
Uh... It's packed out there!

Ritsu:
Well, it is supposed to be the welcome party for all the new students.

Tsumugi:
If we play like we always do, we'll be fine.

Mio:
B-b-but we don't...

Ritsu:
You're still not over your stage fright, huh?

Yui:
Ritchan! I just found a one dollar coin!

Ritsu:
I wish you would be more nervous.

Mio:
The order is: "Fuwa Fuwa Time", "Curry, Then Rice", "My Love is a Stapler", "Brush Pen, Ballpoint Pen".

Ritsu:
Your taste in song titles is as unique as I've ever seen.

Mio:
Really?

Yui:
So, do you really want me to sing all the vocals today?

Ritsu:
That's right, we never decided on that. I've got it. Since we're lucky enough to have two singers, I think that you should do at least one song today, Mio.

Mio:
Huh?!

Ritsu:
C'mon, high five!

Mio:
No way! Forget it! I can't!

Yui:
Oh, Mio...

Ritsu:
But everybody loved you singing in our last show.

Mio:
Forget it!

Ritsu:
Come on, accidents like that don't happen twice.

Mio:
No!

Tsumugi:
But, Mio...

Mio:
Ah!

Yui:
Mio-chan...

Mio:
No!

Yui:
You want ramen?

Mio:
No!

Tsumugi:
So then, no gyoza?

Mio:
No!

Ritsu:
Boy, that's one serious rejection response.

Sawako:
I guess we have no choice. We'll have to let Yui handle everything.

Announcer:
Next up is a club introduction and performance by the Light Music Club.

Ritsu:
Looks like we're on!

Sawako:
Break a leg. And I have just one last word for you all before I go...

Ritsu:
What is it?

Sawako:
Uniforms as costumes are great!

Ritsu:
Would you please clear off the stage now?

Ui:
Really? You've decided?

Jun:
Yeah, the Jazz Appreciation Club has some cool upperclassmen in it. I'm sorry.

Ui:
Well, if that's the club you want to be in, then that's the club you should join. It's your decision after all.

Jun:
See you.

Ui:
Hm...
Hm? Uh, excuse me!

Azusa:
Uh...

Ui:
Sorry to drag you with me like this. Oh, wow, it really is packed in here!
Wow, my sister is on vocals today.

Ui:
Hi, we're the Light... the Light Music Club. To all you new students out there, congratulations on getting into our school. When I first heard about the Light Music Club, I thought all they did was playing lighthearted music.

Ritsu:
Yui's banter is doing a good job putting everybody at ease.

Yui:
I signed up without giving it much thought, thinking I could just play castanets or something simple like that. So I hope all of you think about joining up with the same carefree attitude!
But you know, Ms. Yamanaka told me one day that castanets are actually really hard to play. Here's our next song.

Ritsu:
'Bout time...

Yui:
Oh, Ms. Yamanaka is our advisor and the music teacher here.

Ritsu:
What are we, a comedy band?!

Yui:
Sorry, Ritchan.
Anyway, here's our next song, "My Love is a Stapler"!

Mio:
That riff is tough, and she's pulling it off perfectly! Except for...
Yui, sing!

Yui:
Ah! I forgot the lyrics!

Yui:
Ah! Uh...! Mio-chan!

Mio:
Hurry up and sing!

Tsumugi:
Um, excuse me girls... You know, no one is going to come in with you glaring out the door like that.

Yui:
Aw, but the crowd at the show was so psyched about us!

Ritsu:
Impossible, not a single person showed up!

Yui:
Oh! ou don't think it's because of the way I messed up, do you?

Mio:
You know, maybe it's because we have such a low membership in our club.

Tsumugi:
Come on now, the tea is ready.

Ritsu:
I suppose we're just gonna have to go and nab up Ui.

Mio:
The poor girl isn't a bug.

Azusa:
Pardon me.

Yui:
Uh, yes?

Azusa:
I'm very interested in joining your club.

Yui:
Um, would you mind repeating that?

Azusa:
I'd like to join the club.

Yui & Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Ah!

Ritsu
We got one!

Ui:
Good for you, Big Sis!

Azusa:
Um, what's this?

Sawako:
It's a pair of cat ears, obviously.

Azusa:
No, I knew that, but, uh...
What am I supposed to do with them? I wonder if they're testing me to see how independent I am.

Yui:
Okay, it's your turn, next, Azusa-chan.

Azusa:
Um, my name's Azusa Nakano, Year 1, Class 2. I look forward to our time together.
Part A
Yui:
Our long sought-after new member has finally arrived to join us at the Light Music Club!

Ritsu:
Welcome to the Light Music Club!

Yui:
Hey, don't just stand there. Sit down.

Tsumugi:
All right, now tell us, what's your name?

Azusa:
Uh, my name is Azu--

Ritsu:
So, what instrument do you play?

Azusa:
Well, I play--

Yui:
So, what's your favorite food?

Ritsu:
What's your favorite color?

Mio:
Calm down, people.

Opening Song
Cagayake!GIRLS by 放課後ティータイム(After School Tea Time)

Azusa:
Um... I'm Azusa Nakano, year 1, class 2. And I play a little bit of guitar.

Ritsu:
Hey, just like Yui does, huh?

Azusa:
I look forward to playing with you, Yui-senpai.

Yui:
Oh! Yui-senpai... Senpai... Senpai...!

Ritsu:
Hey! Come back to Planet Earth!

Yui:
For starters, try playing something for us.

Azusa:
I'm still a beginner, so I'm not very good yet.

Yui:
No problem! I'm gonna teach you everything I know!

Mio:
Wow, you're starting to act like a senpai already.

Azusa:
Uh, well, here goes.

Mio:
Sh-she's great!

Yui:
She's way better than I am!

Azusa:
Uh... Uh-oh. What should I do? They are acting all strange all of a sudden. I bet it was because I played so badly.
I'm so sorry. My playing must have been awful to listen to.

Mio:
No, that's not why we reacted like that!

Yui:
You have a ways to go.

Mio & Ritsu:
Huh?!

Ritsu:
Ah! What's with you? Yui, how long are you gonna keep acting cocky?

Yui:
Uh!

Yui & Ritsu:
Oh!

Azusa:
Ah! Yui-senpai, I would really love to hear you play the guitar again!

Yui & Mio & Ritsu:
Huh?

Mio & Ritsu:
Uh...

Yui:
Oh. W-well... I threw my back out during the show, so maybe a little later, okay?

Mio:
Lame...

Ritsu:
Whatever. Just move it.
Well, in any event, I guess we can assume you're going to be joining the club, right?

Azusa:
Yes! I was very moved and excited when I heard you all play at the welcoming ceremony! I look forward to playing with you.

Yui:
Aw... She's so dazzling I can't even look at her!

Azusa:
Oh, that's right.
My application form.

Ritsu:
Duly received and accepted. So, we'll see you here tomorrow, then?

Azusa:
You will. I guess I better get going now.

Yui:
Oh, no! What am I gonna do?!

Mio & Ritsu:
Go start practicing.

Azusa:
Hello, everyone!

Ritsu:
Wow, someone's awfully cheery.

Azusa:
Yes, the end of the school day couldn't come fast enough.

Ritsu:
Let's get to it, then!

Azusa:
To practice you mean?

Ritsu:
No, have tea.

Azusa:
Eh?!

Tsumugi:
Here's a cup for you, Azusa.

Azusa:
Are you sure? I mean, is it okay for us to have tea in the Music Room like this?

Ritsu:
Yeah. Don't sweat it, it's fine!

Azusa:
Um, Ma'am, this isn't...

Sawako:
I'll have milk with my tea.

Azusa:
Huh?!

Sawako:
I'm Ms. Yamanaka, your advisor. Nice to meet you.

Azusa:
Um... It's nice to meet you, too.
Wow, she sure is pretty.

Sawako:
I think she'd look good in cat ears.

Tsumugi:
Have some sweets, too.

Ritsu:
Sure!

Yui:
They look just as good as always...

Sawako:
So, you have a new member. Spring has come, alright?

Ritsu:
So, did you get yourself a boyfriend yet?

Sawako:
Don't bring that up! It's none of your business!

Ritsu:
All right, sorry.

Azusa:
This is the Light Music Club, isn't it? Oh, maybe they're testing me to see if I have initiative.

Sawako:
QUIET!!

Azusa:
Ah!

Yui & Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Uh...

Ritsu:
Ms. Yamanaka, you moron!

Sawako:
I just... I just wanted to enjoy my tea in peace...

Ritsu:
Maybe, but there's a right way to say it.

Mio:
Hey, sorry. Ms. Yamanaka's a little bit strange.

Sawako:
Heard that.

Tsumugi:
Don't let her get to you.

Yui:
C'mon, let's eat some cake!

Ritsu:
Teatime is our main selling point, after all.

Tsumugi:
Azusa-chan?

Azusa:
It's not supposed to be like this!

Mio:
She's flipped out!

Azusa:
I don't sense any motivation from any of you!

Ritsu:
Um, well, our welcome show was over, so...

Azusa:
That has nothing to do with it! It's wrong for you to treat the Music Room as your personal property! You should get rid of all these tea sets!

Sawako:
No, please! Anything but that!

Azusa:
You're a teacher! How can you say that?!

Ritsu:
Look, let's all calm down and jus--

Azusa:
How do you expect me to be calm, huh?! Ah?!

Yui:
That's a good girl.

Mio:
Petting her isn't gonna calm her... It calmed her down!

Azusa:
I'm so sorry I lost my composure.

Yui:
Oh, that's okay, we don't mind at all.

Azusa:
That's a problem too...

Mio:
No, Azusa, you have a very good point. We really ought to show a little more motivation around here. We clear on that?!

Yui & Sawako:
Yeah...

Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Mm-hm.

Azusa:
I don't really want to go, not after that scene I caused...

Azusa:
Hi, everyone... Huh?!
They aren't fazed at all...

Yui:
W-we were all just about to start band practice! Honest, we were!

Yui:
Uh...

Azusa:
That was fast.

Yui:
I just don't have any energy if I don't eat some cake...

Tsumugi:
Here, have a bite.

Yui:
Hm? Aaah... Oh!

Azusa:
She's good!

Yui:
Ah... Why don't you have some, Azusa-chan? It's really good.
Say, "Ah"!

Azusa:
Uh...

Yui:
Go on.

Azusa:
Tasty...

Ritsu:
Hm! What did you say?

Azusa:
I... said "wasty"! A waste!

Ritsu:
Haha...

Azusa:
Uh...

Yui:
Oh, I guess she really didn't like it. Hm...
Try this.

Azusa:
Ah!

Yui:
Try it.

Azusa:
Ah!

Yui:
Oh! Interesting.

Girls:
Good bye, Ms. Yamanaka.

Sawako:
Good bye, girls.
No more afterschool tea time in the Music Room after today... Nevertheless, I must act like a teacher, once in a while.
Hi, girls! Are you practicing really hard?
Oh, c'mon! You're eating!

Sawako:
Now I can die happy...

Ritsu:
Please don't.

Sawako:
So, tell me, why did you decide against getting rid of all these tea sets?

Azusa:
Well, because... I thought it would be wrong of me to reject everything since I'm new.

Yui & Mio & Ritsu & Sawako:
Oh!

Yui:
So, when did you start playing guitar, Azusa-chan?

Azusa:
Um, Let's see. Around fourth grade, I guess. My parents play in a jazz band, so I was really influenced by that.

Mio:
Ah!

Ritsu:
That means you're not a beginner at all!

Azusa:
I'm curious what it was that got you interested in playing guitar, Yui-senpai?

Yui:
W-who, me?
I can't say it! I can't tell her I joined because I thought the club played lighthearted music!
Yeah, anyway, it sure is great that a new member's joined the club!

Ritsu:
She dodged it!

Sawako:
Almost forgot! I brought a welcome-to-the-club present for you, Azusa-chan!
Ta-da!

Azusa:
So, um... what exactly are those?

Sawako:
They're a set of cat ears, of course.

Azusa:
I can see that. That's not what I meant.
What am... I supposed to do with them?

Ritsu:
It's okay, don't worry. It's kind of a Light Music Club ritual.

Azusa:
What kind of ritual!?

Sawako:
Goodness, you embarrass so easily.

Azusa:
Of course I do! The rest of you think this is embarrassing, too, right?

Tsumugi:
So?

Yui:
Looks great!

Ritsu:
Huh? That's our Mugi, all right.

Azusa:
Huh? Am I the odd one out here?

Yui:
Here, Now it's your turn, Azusa-chan.

Azusa:
Uh...

Yui & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Ah!

Yui:
They look awesome on you!

Sawako:
When it comes to this stuff, I'm never wrong.

Yui & Ritsu & Tsumugi & Sawako:
The Light Music Club welcomes you!

Azusa:
This was it!?

Yui:
Oh, Azusa-chan, you're so cute, you know that?

Ritsu:
Try something like a cat, "nya". Like that.

Azusa:
N-nya...

Yui & Ritsu & Tsumugi & Sawako:
Wow...

Azusa:
I couldn't help it.

Yui:
That's it! Your nickname has to be "Azunyan"!

Sawako:
Next, put on this outfit! You'll be a cat-eared maid!

Azusa:
No way! Absolutely not!

Yui:
But it'll look great!

Azusa:
I won't!

Ritsu:
Azusa is so cute. It's great that the object of their teasing is Azusa now instead of me. But this loneliness that I'm feeling...
What is it?

Mio:
What the heck have you been talking about?

Yui:
Hmm... That was so fun.

Azusa:
I'm exhausted even though we didn't practice at all.

Mio:
Oops, I forgot something back up in the Music Room.

Ritsu:
Okay, we'll go on ahead, then.

Mio:
Yeah, okay.

Mio:
Oh! There it is!
Hm?
Mm...

Ritsu:
Hehehe...

Mio:
Uh! A m-mustache!

Ritsu:
That's lame, Mio.

Yui:
You know, Azunyan, there's a fantastic ice cream shop really near where my house is.

Azusa:
Uh...

Tsumugi:
Why don't we all go there?

Yui:
Great idea! It'll be my treat!

Azusa:
Um, okay.

Yui:
No, no. You have to answer "Nya!". Okay?

Azusa:
Uh...

Yui:
See, "Nya!"

Azusa:
N-nya...

Ritsu:
Purr, purr, purr, purr!

Mio:
She's being domesticated!?

Yui:
This is great!

Tsumugi:
It's delicious, all right.

Mio:
You've got some on your cheek.

Azusa:
Uh?

Mio:
Are you okay? Do you think you can handle our club?

Azusa:
Yeah, I guess. It's just to me the relaxed atmosphere is kinda... you know.

Yui:
It's okay. You'll get used to it.

Azusa:
I don't exactly want to.

Ritsu:
So, what's the emergency meeting about?

Mio:
We have a brand-new member. So I think we're asking for trouble if we keep goofing off like this all the time.

Yui:
Y-you do?

Mio:
If we keep this up, Azusa might get tired of it and quit.

Yui:
Ah... I don't want Azunyan to stop coming!

Ritsu:
Then we've no choice. We have to find some dirt and-- Ow!

Mio:
Maybe we should try coming up with a proper activities plan.

Tsumugi:
An activities plan?

Ritsu:
She has a point. For starters... Oh! Let's throw a welcome party for Azusa!

Yui:
Good idea!

Tsumugi:
Sounds like fun!

Mio:
Wait a minute!

Boy:
Cootchie cootchie coo!

Yui:
C'mon, Azunyan, eat up! There is plenty!

Tsumugi:
We have cake, too.

Ritsu:
And I brought this for you!

Mio:
Cut that out!
You... like taiyaki?

Azusa:
Mm.

Ritsu:
Hey! Watch where you're throwing, you idiot!

Yui:
You can do it, Ritchan!

Azusa:
Hm... Mio is a great bassist. So why is she in such an unmotivated club?

Mio:
Hm? What is it?

Azusa:
Um, nothing.
Uh, Mio? Do you play in any bands outside the Light Music Club?

Mio:
Uh? Hm. Playing in a band outside the club would be fun, alright.

Ritsu:
Oh, are you sure you want to be saying things like that?

Mio:
Oh! W-what's that a picture of!? Let me see it! What is it!?

Azusa:
Is she being blackmailed into staying?

Sawako:
The bunny look works, too.

Azusa:
Whoa, ah!

Yui:
Hi, Ms. Yamanaka!

Sawako:
Sorry I'm late, everyone. I had a few things to get together first.
Ta-da!

Tsumugi:
Oh! It's so sweet!

Ritsu:
Yeah. Awesome as always.

Yui:
Azunyan, if you don't want to wear them, we'll be happy to!

Azusa:
That's not the problem...

Yui:
That was so much fun!

Ritsu:
So, where should we go next time?

Tsumugi:
Why don't we go to the zoo?

Sawako:
A hot spring would be nice, too.

Yui:
Oh! Good idea!

Tsumugi:
Yes, it's a wonderful idea!

Sawako:
You think so? You really want to go to one next time?

Mio:
Listen up, everyone!

Yui & Ritsu & Tsumugi & Sawako:
Huh?

Mio:
We're the Light Music Club! Starting tomorrow, we're going to practice. Is that clear? No ifs, ands, or buts! You got it!

Yui & Ritsu & Tsumugi & Sawako:
Mm-hm.

Ritsu:
Okay, we're supposed to be the Light Music Club, even though you may have all forgotten.

Mio:
Yeah, well, I remember just fine.

Ritsu:
Today, we're gonna practice!

Yui & Tsumugi:
Yeah!

Mio & Azusa:
Y-yeah...

Ritsu:
Okay now, since we have Yui and Azusa on guitar now, that oughta widen our range quite a bit. Who wants to play lead guitar?

Azusa:
Well, the lead guitarist should be...

Yui:
Me! Me! I want to do it!

Ritsu:
Where's this confidence coming from?

Yui:
Humph!

Ritsu:
I suppose it would make more sense to decide after we hear you both play.

Azusa:
Um, I guess I'll go first, then...

Tsumugi:
Azusa is terrific.

Mio:
She's a great player.

Ritsu:
Okay, now Yu-- Huh?!

Yui:
I threw out my back!

Ritsu:
Give it a rest, already!

Yui:
Azunyan, please teach me how to play guitar!

Ritsu:
Whoa! She is quick on her feet!

Azusa:
Um, I think you should use muting on that part. And I think that last phrase would sound better with a little vibrato.

Yui:
Muting? Vibrato? What are those?

Azusa:
Ah?!

Mio:
Believe it or not, she's been playing for a year now.

Azusa:
How can she get by without knowing muting and vibrato?
Hey, wait. She's using muting just fine.

Yui:
Oh, that's what you call that. So that's muting?

Sawako:
"Muting" is a fingering technique where you lightly touch the strings to dampen the notes as you play them.

Mio:
Yui is the type of person who doesn't read the manual when she buys a game.

Azusa:
Hmm... I can see that.

Sawako:
Could you please put some royal milk tea on for me?

Tsumugi:
Oh... I'm sorry, but today we're only going to practice.

Ritsu:
I suppose we can take a little break.

Mio:
Uh!? What about practice?!

Ritsu:
We'll work harder starting tomorrow.

Yui:
Azunyan! Now say "Ah"!

Tsumugi:
I have a special cup just for you, Azusa-chan.

Azusa:
This will ruin me. If I stay here, it will ruin me!

Azusa:
I should play in other bands outside the Light Music Club. There have to be other great bands out there.
I don't get it. All these other bands are better than the Light Music Club.
So why?

Yui:
Azunyan hasn't come in a while.

Mio:
She might not come back.

Ritsu:
Azusa! Why haven't you come to the club lately? We've been practicing every day since you were here last.

Yui:
We've been waiting for you to come back!

Mio:
Uh... Something wrong?

Ritsu:
Oh. You didn't come just tell us that you're quitting?

Yui:
No way, please anything but that!

Azusa:
I don't know anymore...

Yui & Mio & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Huh?

Azusa:
I don't know why I wanted to join your club anymore. Or why your show touched me so much in a way that it did. I thought that I could figure it out if I hung around you for a little while. But... but I just don't know anymore...

Yui:
Azunyan...

Ritsu:
Right! Let's play a number for Azusa, then! Let's make her remember what she was feelings that day, okay?!

Azusa:
Yui-senpai hardly knows any musical lingo at all. Ritsu's drumming is always kind of wild. So why are their songs so good when the four of them play together?
Why?

Mio:
Azusa. You asked me the other day why I don't play in bands outside the club, remember?

Azusa:
Uh, yeah.

Mio:
I think it's because I love being in a band with these girls.
I bet the others feel the same. I think that's why we all play so well together.
C'mon! Play a song with us, Azusa!

Azusa:
Uh... All right! I really want to play music with you guys! I really do!

Yui:
Oh, what a relief!

Mio:
Now, I know there's gonna be times when we're gonna slack off and drink tea or whatever. But I think that time is crucial for us.

Yui:
I'm so burned out...

Ritsu:
I don't think I'm gonna want to play for at least a whole week...

Azusa:
Are they serious?

Mio:
Probably...

Yui:
Azunyan, why don't you try on those cat ears?

Azusa:
Huh? What? No way!

Yui:
Please! It'll make me try harder!

Azusa:
Oh...

Yui:
The power of cute compels you!

Ending Song
Don't say "lazy" by 放課後ティータイム(After School Tea Time)

Ritsu:
It must be rough to be a teacher and working during summer break.

Sawako:
Yeah, we have to go to seminars and whatnot... Are you guys practicing?

Yui:
Yeah.

Sawako:
Did you want something?

Ritsu:
The Light Music Club is gonna have a training camp.

Yui:
And we were all wondering if you wanted to come?

Sawako:
A training camp, huh?

Ritsu:
She doesn't look too thrilled about it, does she?

Azusa:
Are we ever gonna get around to practicing?

Yui:
Azunyan!

Ritsu:
Gimme the cabbage!
K-ON!

Ui:
Hello, Ui Hirasawa here.
I'm hanging out with Azusa-chan for the first time today.

Azusa:
Hey!

Ui:
Ah, Azusa!

Azusa:
Sorry!

Ui:
What a cute outfit!
Oh, you're going to that training camp with the Light Music Club, aren't you?

Azusa:
I am. It's three days and four nights.

Ui:
My sister says that the one they all went last year turned out to be a lot of fun.

Azusa:
A lot of fun?
I bet she meant they practiced the whole time, didn't she?

Ui:
Uh... Um... Uh... Yeah.
I think so.

Yui:
Huh? Ui! Isn't this cute?!

Azusa:
Oh, I see. I mean, after all, the four of them play so amazingly well together.
They must practice a lot there
Right?



Ui:
What's my sister like when she's at the Light Music Club?

Azusa:
Well, I guess she's kinda...

Ui:
Tell me!

Azusa:
She really doesn't practice at all.
And she gave me a pretty weird nickname.

Yui:
Azu-nyan!

Azusa:
She's all touchy-feely all the time.

Ui:
Yeah, my sister really is warm and sweet, isn't she?

Azusa:
Um, that wasn't exactly what I meant.

Ui:
Huh?

Azusa:
So, what is Yui-senpai doing today?

Ui:
She's at home.
Sis doesn't handle heat very well.
She hates air-conditioning, too.

Azusa:
I can picture her sprawled out on the floor.

Ui:
She's been lying around the house all day lately.

Azusa:
Talk about lazy.

Ui:
But she's so cute when she's lying around.
She's adorable!

Yui:
Ui! Ui! Ui, Ui, Ui, Ui...

Azusa:
Why do Ui and I see her sister so differently?
You know, lately I've been wishing I had a big sister who was a lot like Mio.

Ui:
Yeah, I think she's really nice, and cool, too.
What about Ritsu?

Azusa:
Well, she's awfully irresponsible and completely unfocused.
I'll pass.

Ritsu:
Oh, who's unfocused?

Azusa:
Ahhhh!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

Ui:
Hello, Ritsu, Nice to see you.

Ritsu:
Hey, I saw you two from outside and I decided to come in.

Ui:
So, you're by yourself today?

Ritsu:
Mm-hm. Mio's out taking some summer classes.

Azusa:
You mean you don't have to go to any, Ritsu-senpai?

Ritsu:
What? Who, me?
Summer classes?
What for?

Azusa:
What was I thinking?
Oh, that reminds me.
I've been meaning to ask you something.

Ritsu:
Uh-huh.

Azusa:
Mugi brings her own tea sets to the club room and fancy cakes and has vacation homes.
Does she come from a really rich family?

Ritsu:
That's for sure!
She even has a butler at home, and the family even leave the country some time to go on long vacations!

Azusa:
They really do that?

Ritsu:
It'd sure be cool if they did, huh?

Azusa:
So, you don't know for sure.

Ritsu:
Hey, why don't we give her a call and go hang out over at her place for a while?

Azusa:
Wait, are you sure?
It's kind of short notice.

Ritsu:
That's weird, she's not answering her cell.
I guess I'll try her home number.

Butler:
Yes, hello.

Ritsu:
Oh, somebody picked up.
Hi, is this Tsumugi's dad I'm speaking to?

Butler:
No, I am in the employ of the Kotobuki family as their butler.

Ritsu & {Font color|#387f9c|Jun} & {Font color|green|Azusa:}}
Wow! They really have a butler!

Ritsu:
Um, well... uh... would Tsumugi happen to be at home, right now?

Azusa:
Senpai, just calm down!

Butler:
I'm very sorry.
But I'm afraid Miss Tsumugi is summering in Finland at the moment.

Ritsu:
Oh, she is?
Thank you very much then.
Sorry to have bothered you.
See? Told you?
It's just exactly like I said.

I'm exhausted for some reason...

Ui:
Want to come over to my house?
We have a nice watermelon.

Ritsu:
Count me in!

Ui:
I'm home!
You here, Sis?!

Ritsu:
Watermelon...

Ui:
Ritsu and Azusa-chan decided to come over here!

Yui:
Welcome home, Ui...

Ritsu:
It's strangely soothing...

Azusa:
It's just like she said.

Ritsu:
Hello, excuse us!

Yui:
There she is!

Ritsu:
It must be rough to be a teacher, and working during summer break.

Sawako:
Yeah, we have to go to seminars and whatnot.
Are you guys practicing?

Yui:
Yeah!

Sawako:
Did you want something?

Ritsu:
The Light Music Club is gonna have a training camp.

Yui:
And we were all wondering if you wanted to come.

Sawako:
A training camp, huh?

Ritsu:
She doesn't look too thrilled about it, does she?

Yui:
Fine. I guess we'll just go by ourselves then.

Ritsu:
She gets mad when we DON'T ask her, and when we DO, this is her response!

Yui:
Too bad, she could've gone swimming and had a barbecue and stuff.

Sawako:
Ah!

Yui:
I can't wait for this training camp!

Ritsu:
All right!
This is our first time together for a while, so why don't we go buy stuff for the training camp?

Azusa:
Hey, by the way, what are we out here to buy today?
Some brand-new gear for the band?

Mio:
Well, uh...

Yui:
Cute swimsuits!

Azusa:
They're ready to goof off!
I had a feeling something like this would happen.

Ritsu:
Hey, we're not gonna play around the whole time.

Azusa:
I can't trust you guys!

Ritsu:
How come!

Mio:
Hey, we'll have to take some breaks, too.
Right?

Azusa:
Mm... Oh, yeah.
I hadn't thought of that.

Ritsu:
What is this loneliness I'm feeling?

Everyone:
Oh!

Ritsu:
This one's even more awesome than the last one!

Yui:
This is the vacation home you said you couldn't borrow for us last year?

Tsumugi:
No, I'm sorry.
That home wasn't available for us this year, either.
I find this one rather cramped, but we just have to put up with it.

Everybody:
You have an even bigger one?!

Ritsu:
Oh, yeah, let's have some fun!

Mio:
Hey!
No playing until AFTER we practice!

Ritsu:
Aw...

Yui:
We wanna have fun!

Mio:
All right,
Majority rules, then.
I vote that we practice first.

Ritsu & Jun & {Font color|red|Yui:}}
Play first!

Azusa:
I want to practice.

Tsumugi:
I vote for playing.

Mio:
Unexpected betrayal!

Yui:
Hurry up!

Ritsu:
Wait for me!

Mio:
I swear, they've got plenty of energy for goofing off.

Azusa:
When Mugi says "playing," I wonder if she means...

Yui:
I'm flying!

Ritsu:
Yes, yes, yes!

Azusa:
No, that could never happen...

Tsumugi:
I told you I didn't need this stuff, didn't I?!
You want to get rid of everything on the beach this instant!
I don't want the yacht, either!

Mio:
Mugi...

Azusa:
senpai...

Yui:
Catch!

Tsumugi:
Back and forth, back and forth!

Mio:
Aren't we ever gonna get around to practicing?

Yui:
Azu-nyan!
Why don't you come out and play with us, Azu-nyan!

Azusa:
No, thank you.

Ritsu:
I see.
You must be pretty bad at sports, huh?

Azusa:
Huh? I am not!
Bring it on!
You'll see what I can do!

Tsumugi:
Azusa has fit in with the club just fine, hasn't she?

Mio:
I suppose.

Yui:
Dr. Ritchan, you should look at this right away!

Azusa:
Hey, Mio.

Mio:
Huh?

Azusa:
You know that all story about corn barnacles, don't you?
A long time ago, a boy cut his foot on a corn barnacle, and...

Mio:
Ahh!

Azusa:
Uh, Mio...
What's the matter?
Mio?

Ritsu:
Hehe.

Yui:
Gotta move up some more!

Yui:
Gimme!

Azusa:
No!

Ritsu:
Mio!

Mio:
I don't know what got into me--

Yui:
Where am I?
A desert island?
Wake up, Ritchan!

Ritsu:
Yui...
Y-Yui!

Yui:
Ritchan!

Ritsu:
We did it.
We made it!

Yui & Jun & {Font color|orange|Ritsu:}}
We've got to the new world!

Ritsu:
Zipangu! The land of gold!

Azusa:
What the heck are they doing?

Ritsu:
We all played out.
Let's all go eat and then call it a night.

Mio:
What about band practice?

Azusa:
I knew it. I knew we should've practiced instead of playing around out here!

Ritsu:
But you played more than anybody, Azusa.
You're sunburned.

Azusa:
Ugh...
Yeah, well, I'm gonna go practice, too!

Ritsu:
All night long?

Azusa:
I will!



Ritsu:
I'm beat... And I'm starving, too.

Mio:
Suck it up.

Azusa:
This is awesome!

Mio:
It's awesome, all right...

Azusa:
I've never used an amp like that before!

Ritsu:
Mio, let's hurry up and practice!
These snares are brand new!

Mio:
Talk about self-serving.

Yui:
Hm? Azu-nyan, what's that thing?

Azusa:
What? Oh, this?
It's just an electronic tuner.

Yui:
Really?
What do you use a tuner for?

Azusa:
You use it to tune your guitar.
Wait a minute.
You've never seen a tuner before?

Yui:
Nope, this is the first one.

Azusa:
How do you tune your guitar, then?

Yui:
Huh? I do it by ear.
See?

Azusa:
S-She has perfect pitch!
I have no idea if she's amazing or not!

Ritsu:
Right, here goes!
One, two, three, four!

Azusa:
Hey, that sounded really great, didn't it?

Tsumugi:
Yes, we were perfect.
You were great, Yui-chan!

Azusa:
I wonder when they had time to practice?

Mio:
You set a perfect tempo over the song, too, Ritsu.
Did you do some cram practicing?

Ritsu:
Uh...
I'm so hungry that I've got absolutely no energy left.

Mio:
I guess the hunger made her lose her extra energy and play better than usual.

Ritsu:
C'mon, let's eat!
Please feed me!

Tsumugi:
Yes, me too.

Yui:
We're back!

Ritsu:
Welcome back!

Tsumugi:
Oh, thanks, Ritsu.

Yui:
Ritchan!
We bring you meat!
And veggies!

Ritsu:
Yay!
A whole head of cabbage!
I'm so hungry I'll eat it raw!

Mio:
Show a little patience, all right?

Ritsu:
Yay!

Azusa:
They goof off all the time, but for some reason they manage to play really well.

Ritsu:
Let go!
The cabbages!
The god of cabbages is angry!

Mio:
If we split up the cutting work, it'll be all ready in no time.

Azusa:
I'll light the grill and start getting everything heated up.

Mio:
See, our new member is taking the initiative and working hard.

Ritsu:
All right, all right...

Yui:
My eyes are burning!

Ritsu:
Yui, sure you can handle it?

Yui:
Ritchan!

Ritsu:
Yui!

Yui:
When we die, we die together!

Ritsu:
Yes!

Mio:
Ready!
So, why don't we make some onigiri?

Azusa:
Right!

Mio:
They're so different!

Ritsu:
I guess it's just that you have man hands, Mio.

Mio:
Shut up!

Yui:
That was delicious!

Azusa:
It was terrific!

Ritsu:
That was awesome, all right!

Tsumugi:
Hey!

Everyone:
Huh?

Tsumugi:
Who's for fireworks?

Tsumugi:
Oh, it burned out.

Ritsu:
You know when fireworks is almost burned completely out, it sort of makes you wanna cheer it on, doesn't it?
You can do it! You can do it! You can do it!

Yui:
You can do it! You can do it!

Tsumugi:
All right, one more time!
You can do it! You can do it!
Ah!
It broke off again.

Yui:
Ritchan, look! It's going out!

Ritsu:
Right!
At times like this, we have to combine and get bigger!

Yui & Jun & Ritsu:
Combine! Form Sparklerman!

Tsumugi:
Hey, no fair!

Mio:
Morons.

Tsumugi:
Is that too heavy?

Azusa:
No, I'm fine.

Ritsu:
Let's test our bravery!

Yui:
Oh!

Mio:
If it's not one thing, it's another...

Ritsu:
Why not?!
We have to have a bravery contest.
It's a camp tradition.

Mio:
Yeah, I'm not doing it.

Ritsu:
Oh, you won't?
You DO have a problem with scary stuff...

Mio:
I can handle it just fine!
So, bring it on, Ritsu!

Ritsu:
Now, you're going to pay dearly for making me wait so long to eat!

Mio:
S-Seriously, Azusa, who still has bravery contests in high school?

Azusa:
Um, you're kinda hurting my hand...
I wonder what that is?

Mio:
I-I bet it's Ritsu up to her usual tricks!

Sawako:
Mio-chan...

Mio:
Ahhhhh!

Azusa:
Mio! Senpai!
Pull it together.
Miss Yamanaka?!
What are you doing here?!

Sawako:
I-I finally found you.

Yui:
Huh? Miss Yamanaka?
What's wrong?
And what're you doing out here?

Sawako:
Well, my plan was to catch up with you and then surprise you all by my sudden arrival.
But I got lost.

Azusa:
It looks like you succeeded in surprising us, anyway.
Regardless of how lost you got.

Tsumugi:
Mio-chan!
Everything is all right!
Mio-chan!

Azusa:
I had no idea Mio got frightened so easily.

Ritsu:
Nobody's coming...

Mio:
That was total hell...

Tsumugi:
Now, now...

Ritsu:
Mio! Mio!

Ritsu:
Azusa, don't you like hot water?

Azusa:
No, that's not it at all.

Yui:
Azu-nyan, at times like this, it's best to just get it over with.

Azusa:
Ow!

Yui:
It was because you were sunburned, huh?

Tsumugi:
Yui-chan, have you lost weight?

Yui:
Huh? No.
Didn't I tell you before?
I can eat all I want, and I never gain any weight at all.

Tsumugi, Mio, Sawako:
I'm so jealous!

Yui:
What?
You, too, Miss Yamanaka?

Sawako:
You know what?
It's strange but I really can't tell the two of you apart without my glasses on.
I guess I'll have to tell you apart based on bust size!

Ritsu:
Gimme the cabbage!

Azusa:
Huh?

Yui:
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you practice with me.

Azusa:
Don't worry about it, Yui. It's all right.
I'd been hoping that I might get a chance some time to practice with you anyway.

Yui:
Thanks a lot.

Azusa:
Let's see...

Yui:
Azu-nyan, you're really good!

Azusa:
Huh? Oh, no!
Not at all!

Yui:
Now, it's my turn to give it a try.
Wow, this part is really tough.

Azusa:
Maybe you should try playing it at a slower tempo at first.

Yui:
Like this?

I did it!
Azu-nyan, I'm so glad I met you!

Azusa:
Huh?

Yui:
Azu-nyan!
Thank you so much, Azu-nyan!

Ui:
Hello, Ui Hirasawa here.
I'm hanging out with Azusa-chan again today.

Azusa:
Hey!
Hi, Ui!
Sorry, I'm late!

Ui:
Hi! What kept you?
Wait, WHO are you?

Ui:
So, I guess you didn't get in much practicing, huh?

Azusa:
Mm... Oh, we did practice some, but I was expecting more intensive training or something.
We basically goofed off most of the time swimming and stuff like that.

Ui:
Mm...

Azusa:
But I wanted to practice a lot more!

Ui:
I see...
Wait a minute! That's weird.
My sister wasn't tan at all.
How did you get so sunburned?

Azusa:
Oh, um...
Because I playing around more than anyone else.
Still though...
I'm really happy I went.
I learned lots of things about the others in the club.

Ui:
Yeah? What kind of things?

Azusa:
Well, like Mio is more of a scaredy-cat than you'd expect.

Ui:
Oh, she is?
What about Ritsu?

Azusa:
Well, She IS unfocused and all, but she and Mio are great together.

Ui:
And what about Mugi?

Azusa:
Let's see...
Mugi is sweet and generous and she's always thinking about others.
And she's got a childlike side to her that's fun and really cute.

Ui:
Oh. Okay, what about my sister?

Azusa:
Well, Yui is...
She buckled down and practiced!

Ui:
I knew it!

Azusa:
But...
She still stays glommed onto me all the time.

Ui:
She's warm and sweet, isn't she?

Azusa:
You know, she is.

Preview

Azusa:
These strings are all xxx.
When was the last time you changed them out for new ones, Yui?

Yui:
Huh? You mean you're supposed to change the strings?

Everybody:
What?

Staff:
Is this a vintage guitar?

Azusa:
No, we're sorry.
It's just kinda dirty, that's all.

Yui:
It's been a year since I bought it.

Azusa:
What if she decides not to come back to the club anymore?
What'll happen to our concert at the school festival?
K-ON!

Azusa:
I never suspected that the Light Music Club...
would face a crisis of these proportions...
so soon before the School Festival.

Ritsu:
You sure are in a good mood, Azusa.

Azusa:
I get happy when I think about actually playing a live show at the festival.

Ritsu:
Oh, that's really cute!

Azusa:
I wish I could see you play at last year's festival.

Ritsu:
Yeah, guess you put on a pretty big show last year, didn't you, Mio?
She tripped while she was up on stage...

Sawako:
Hey, I just happen to have a recording of their last year show.

Azusa:
I wanna see! I wanna see!

Mio:
Are you sure you won't reconsider, Azusa?

Sawako:
Yui, Ritsu.

Mio:
Wait! No. Let go...

Sawako:
Now, let's start with the primo scene.

Mio:
Don't look, Azusa!
It's too dangerous! You'll be cursed!

Azusa:
I can't unsee it.

Mio:
I was too late...


Azusa:
It's pretty weird.
You guys seem to only play incredibly well during live performances.

Ritsu:
Oh, look at you, offering up opinions and everything!
Head lock!

Yui:
(chuckle)

Tsumugi:
What is it, Yui?

Yui:
This is bringing back a lot of fun memories.

Tsumugi:
As I recall, you (grided) your voice just before we did this show.

Yui:
Yeah! My voice was all scratchy when I woke up that morning.

Tsumugi:
That's right.
So Mio took over --

Ritsu:
This would be your first show as a member of the Light Music Club.

Azusa:
Yeah! I'm gonna give it all I've got!

Nodoka:
Sorry to interrupt when you're having such a good time.

Mio:
Oh, Nodoka! What's going on?

Nodoka:
Don't act like you don't know.
This!.

Ritsu:
Auditorium Use Application...

Nodoka:
Right.
You haven't submitted one for the School Festival.

Ritsu:
Oh, I completely forgot.

Azusa:
Don't be so nonchalant!

Ritsu:
Things've been kinda hectic, so it slipped my mind.

Nodoka:
The same thing happened last year.

Ritsu:
Actually, that was the Club Application...
Ow!

Ritsu:
Okay, Azusa, you be the secretary.

Azusa:
Me? Well, I guess I don't mind.
Let's see, Applicant is Light Music Club...
So, what do I put down for Name?

Ritsu:
The band name, I guess.

Azusa:
Right.
Now that you mention it, what is the band's name?

Ritsu & Yui & Jun & Mio:
The Girls Gang! Smile and Sweets! Chocolate Melody!

Azusa:
They're all different!

Tsumugi:
We never settled on one.

Ritsu:
Then it's the perfect time to pick a name!

Yui:
I got it! How about 'Yui Hirasawa and the Bumbling Sisters?'

Ritsu:
What are we, chopped liver?

Mio:
How about something like 'Pure Pure'?

Ritsu:
Ah, enough with the jokes, let's be serious about this.

Mio:
But I was being serious...

Ritsu:
You really meant that?!

Azusa:
Well, everyone has different tastes.
Doesn't make that wrong?

Sawako:
All right, then!
I'll choose the band name!

Everyone:
I think we should all give it a little more thought!

Azusa:
They pulled together...

Nodoka:
Just bring the paperwork to the Student Council Office when you're done.

Mio:
I'm sorry we made you wait for nothing.

Nodoka:
It's all right.

Yui:
Nodoka-chan, why don't you and I stop'n grab some tea on the way home!

Nodoka:
Sure, Yui, I'll text you later.

Ritsu:
Okay, why don't we all just sleep on the band name tonight and get to practicing our set for the show now?

Tsumugi:
I agree.

Mio:
The Festival's soon, so we have to give it 110%.

Azusa:
I will!

Yui:
Oh, sound!
My guitar hasn't really been sounding quite right lately.

Azusa:
You want me to take a quick look at it?

Azusa:
These strings are all clouded!
When was the last time you changed them out for new ones, Yui?

Yui:
You mean you're supposed to change the strings?

Everyone:
What?

Azusa:
Plus, the neck is warped.
Didn't you know that a warped guitar neck'll completely throw off the octave tuning!

Yui:
Neck? Octa...?

Mio:
Calm down, Azusa!
This is way too much for Yui to digest!

Azusa:
Basically, you have to take really good care of your instrument.
This is a beautiful guitar!

Yui:
But I do take good care of it!
I sleep with it every night, I dress it up nice!

Azusa:
That's not what I mean by ‘taking care of it!'

Yui:
In that case, is there anything you can do to fix it, Miss. Yamanaka?

Sawako:
Gah, I think you'd be better off taking it to the music store, don't you?

Ritsu:
You just can't be bothered.

Azusa:
You and I better just go to the music store, then.

Yui:
It isn't that serious, is it?

Azusa:
The festival's coming up, and we can't practice with your guitar and the shape it's in!

Yui:
Ritchan, you don't do any upkeep on your drums, do you?

Ritsu:
Yes, I do!
And even if I didn't, don't make it sound like a foregone conclusion that I don't.

Yui:
It is you we're talking about...
Ow!

Ritsu:
Okay, here we are.

Mio:
Hey, I'll wait for you guys out here, okay?

Azusa:
But, why aren't you coming inside?

Mio:
You see the thing is I'm a lefty, so looking at all those right handed instruments would only make me sad.

TsumugiJun & Azusa:
Ah.

Ritsu:
Hey Mio, check this out!
It says here that they're having a Lefty Fair today.

Mio:
Aha... Have I died and gone to heaven?
C-Clerk! I want you to give me everything you have on display here!

Ritsu:
Hey Mio, get a grip, girl.

Yui:
Boy, Mio-chan sure looks happy.

Azusa:
That's 'cause there's not a lot of models made for lefties.
So you wanna just go on without them?

Yui:
Mm-hm.

Azusa:
Excuse us!

Clerk1:
How can I help you?

Azusa:
We were wandering if you could make some adjustment on a guitar for us.

Clerk1:
Yeah, sure thing.
On which guitar?

Azusa:
This one.

Clerk1:
Ah.
Well, why don't we have a look at it and see what we've got.
Um, ah, is this a vintage guitar?

Azusa:
No, we're sorry.
It's just kinda dirty.
That's all.

Yui:
It's been a year since I bought it!

Clerk1:
I-I see...
Well, feel free to wait in the store until I'm finished with it.

Azusa:
Thank you very much.
Well, let's browse around the store until he's done.
Hey, what's the matter, Yui?

Yui:
My poor guitar is being stripped naked bit by bit!

Azusa:
What are you talking about?
I'm curious about something, Yui?
Why did you buy that guitar in the first place?
I mean, look at it.
It's heavy, and it's got a thick neck.
It's got all sorts of quirks.

Yui:
I got it because it's cute!

Azusa:
Because it's cute?

Yui:
Yeah, that's right.
Huh? You do think it's cute, don't you, Azusa?

Azusa:
I just don't get Yui-senpai's tastes.

Azusa:
Sorry we kept you waiting!
We dropped it off to have them do some maintenance.

Ritsu:
Right, good deal.

Azusa:
Wait a minute.
Where did Mio-senpai go?

Tsumugi:
Oh, Mio is still over there checking out...

Clerk2:
Miss Kotobuki!
It's so good to see you again, Miss!

Tsumugi:
Oh, hello.

Clerk3:
Hey! If it isn't Miss Kotobuki!
It's been way too long!

Ritsu:
Mugi says that this shop is part of her family's business consortium.

Azusa:
Ah...

Yui:
It's always a shock to hear someone call her that, isn't it?

Clerk1:
Thank you for waiting.

Ritsu:
It's all clean again!

Azusa:
Make sure you keep it maintained from now on.

Yui:
Geeta!

Ritsu:
She named the thing...

Yui:
Oh, thank you so much, sir!

Clerk1:
D-Don't mention it.
So, ah, the bill comes to $50.

Yui:
Huh? You charge for this?

Clerk1:
Um, y-yes.

Azusa:
Well, of course they charge for it!

Yui:
I have no money.
What do I do?

Tsumugi:
What's the matter?

Azusa:
Well, it looks like Yui-senpai didn't know that music stores charge for maintenance work.

Tsumugi:
Oh, she didn't, huh? Oh, goodness.
Did I bring any pocket money?

Clerk2:
O-Oh, M-Miss, no! Perish the thought! Consider it on the house!

Everyone:
Eh?

Tsumugi:
No, I couldn't possibly!

Clerk2:
Please, think nothing of it!
We're constantly in your father's debt!

Tsumugi:
B-But I...

Clerk2:
I insist!
Please, this is on the house!

Ritsu:
Well, looks like you just lucked out.

Ritsu:
That's that, then! What do you say we all get going?

Yui & Jun & Azusa:
Yeah!

Azusa:
Um...
Aren't we forgetting Mio-senpai?

Ritsu:
Yeah, I'll go call her.
Mio! Come on, it's time to go.

Mio:
Don't wanna.

Ritsu:
Are you a grade schooler?
Look, everybody's waiting for you and we have to get back.

Mio:
Don't wanna.

Ritsu:
Sheesh! Come on, Mio, let's go!

Mio:
Hey! Ritsu!

Ritsu:
It's time to go home now, Mio.

Mio:
I said I don't wanna go!

Azusa:
I know this one person who actually likes to string his guitar in reverse order.

Yui:
Ho.

Ritsu:
Too bad, we're going.
And that's that

Mio:
Hey, wait! Watch it!

Ritsu:
Ah...
Hey, what'cha doing down there, Mio?

Mio:
Enough, already!
You jerk.

Yui:
Thank goodness, Geeta is all pretty again!

Mio:
You gave your guitar a name, huh?
That's nice.

Tsumugi:
So, what do you want to do now?

Ritsu:
Good question...
Hey, how about going for tea?!

Azusa:
Tea again?
Really?

Yui:
Sorry, guys!
But I'm supposed to get together with Nodoka-chan right now.

Ritsu:
Ah.

Mio:
You gonna see Nodoka? Can I tag along?

Yui:
Oh, that's right!
You and Nodoka-chan are in the same class together, aren't you?
Sure.

Mio:
Really?

Yui: I'm just gonna give her a call and let her know you're coming.

Mio:
Great, thanks!

Ritsu:
Um...


Yui:
Oh, I always wanted to try out this place!

Mio:
But you have no money?

Nodoka:
It's okay.
I'll pay for Yui's share.

Yui:
When I get next month's allowance, we'll all go out and it'll all be on me, how's that?!

Nodoka:
I'll hold you to that.
So, is Yui really doing all right at the Light Music Club like she says?

Mio:
Yeah! But, whenever she learns one thing, she has a tendency to completely forget something else.

Nodoka:
I know how it is.
But when she's focused on something, she can do amazing things.

Mio:
That's for sure.

Nodoka:
She can be a real handful, can't she?

Yui:
Huh?
What'cha talking about?

Ritsu:
Duh! Those two sure seem to be having a good time together.

Azusa:
More to the point, why are we sneaking around like this?

Tsumugi:
It's like for private investigators, isn't it?

Ritsu:
That's it!
I'm going in.

Mio:
And then the teacher came up to me and

Ritsu:
Well, you two sure seem really friendly!
Hey!

Mio:
Ritsu?
What are you doing here?

Ritsu:
Oh, I just happened to be here.

Yui:
Did you come here all by yourself?

Ritsu:
Nope, Mugi and Azusa're sitting over there.

Yui:
Ha? Hey, they are!

Ritsu:
Oh, gosh!
Thank you for taking such good care of our little Mio!

Mio:
Ritsu?

Ritsu:
What? You want me to leave?

Mio:
Well, no, I don't, but I …

Ritsu:
Then what's the problem?
Oo, what's that?
What did you get?

Tsumugi:
What's she doing?
Her ice cream is melting...

Mio:
Wow, that's a gorgeous boxed lunch!

Nodoka:
No, it's not.
I just threw together whatever I had lying around.

Mio:
You mean you make your own?
That's amazing!

Nodoka:
Oh, come on.
It's no big deal, really.

Mio:
No, mine are always

Ritsu:
Okay, lunchtime is over!

Mio:
Ah? Ritsu?
Sorry, but I just started eating.

Ritsu:
We're practicing through every lunch break from now until the school festival!

Mio:
Ah…

Ritsu:
Gee, I wonder what Mio's gonna do to liven things up at this year's big school festival concert?
She gave the crowd that panty shot last year, so maybe she'll show them her belly button this time?
Ooh. Or maybe

Mio:
I thought we were gonna practice!

Ritsu:
And we will!

Mio:
Then why are you

Ritsu:
Takoyaki!
Ponytail!

Mio:
Hey!

Ritsu:
Braids!

Mio:
Come on, cut it out!
What's gotten into you?

Ritsu:
Oh, guess what I brought!
A great horror movie!
So scary, It'll make your hair stand up.

Mio:
This is stupid.
I'm going back to my classroom.

Ritsu:
All right.
Suit yourself.
Gosh, I'm so sorry I interrupted your wonderfully pleasant lunchtime with Nodoka, your brand new best friend.

Mio:
Who said anything about that?!

Yui:
Ah… I don't get it why they're fighting?

Tsumugi:
How about some tea?
Let's have some tea!
All right?
I brought some lovely tarts today.

Azusa:
What should I do?

Tsumugi:
All right?

Azusa:
I have to do something!
Anything!
L-Let's all be friends and practice together like we planned!
I-It didn't work!

Ritsu:
Yeah, I guess we should practice.

Mio:
Let's get started.

Azusa:
S-Sure!
All right!

Ritsu:
One, two!

Mio:
Ritsu?
What gives? I'm glad that your drumming isn't as wild as usual but don't you think it's a little weak?
Ritsu?
Ritsu, what is it?

Ritsu:
Aw, sorry.
I'm just not feeling it right now.
Let's try it again after school.

Yui:
R-Ritchan!

Mio:
Let her go, Yui.

Yui:
But she

Mio:
Twerp.

Azusa:
I guess Ritsu isn't coming.
She didn't come after school yesterday, either.

Yui:
I wonder what's wrong?

Sawako:
I'd say it was because Mio has been being so cold to her.
For the sake of the Light Music Club, you need to be Ritsu's plaything for at least today!
If you don't, Ritsu's heart will grow hardened.

Ritsu:
Hey mister!
A jumbo!

Sawako:
And she'll order a jumbo beef bowl she knows she can't finish.

Ritsu:
What am I doing?

Sawako:
She'll be driven to despair and she'll go so far down the path of heavy metal, she'll never find her way back!

Yui:
That's what happened to you when you got dumped by your boyfriend, isn't it?

Sawako:
Pardon?

Azusa:
What if she decides not to come back to the club any more?
What'll happen to our concert at the school festival?

Mio:
Come on, let's practice.

Yui:
You mean, without Ritchan?

Mio:
What else can we do?

Azusa:
But shouldn't we go ask her to join us first?

Sawako:
You could start looking for a replacement.
Now, I'm just saying that it's always a good idea to be prepared.

Yui:
But...

Tsumugi:
There's no replacing Ritchan!

Yui:
Mugi-chan...

Tsumugi:
Let's just wait.
Let's wait for Ritsu to come back to us.
I know she'll come.
I know it.

Tsumugi:
Mio!

Yui:
Mugi-chan, you're right!

Mio:
Oh, uh… Good morning.

Yui:
Listen Mio, about Ritchan, she is…

Mio:
Look, I..
I didn't come here to check up on Ritsu, I, uh...

Tsumugi:
She's been staying home from school.

Ritsu:
Mio...

Mio:
So, now you have ESP?

Ritsu:
I think I can recognize your footsteps.

Mio:
How's the cold?

Ritsu:
I still have a bit of a fever.

Mio:
I guess that explains why your drumming sounded so weak.

Ritsu:
Heck of a time to get sick, right before the festival...

Mio:
You just get better quick, okay?
We're waiting for you to come back.

Ritsu:
They're not mad?

Mio:
They're not.

Ritsu:
Are you?

Mio:
Of course, not.
How can I be mad at you?
It's just...

Ritsu:
Just what?

Mio:
Without you there drumming, I guess it's kinda lonely.
Even though you're pretty wild, I really like how your drumming is always so full of energy and powerful.

Mio:
Ritsu!
Were you --

Ritsu:
Hooray, I'm cured!
Achoo!

Mio:
Oh, Ritsu, you are not!
Come on now, lie down.
You still have a fever.
I'm going home, okay?

Ritsu:
Ho… Come on, don't go yet.
Stay until I fall asleep, please…

Mio:
Oh, good grief.

Yui:
Excuse us.
Can we come in?
Ritchan, how are you do

Mio:
Shh! I was finally able to get her to go to sleep.

Mio:
Um… Why did Yui fall asleep, too?
Oh, good grief...

Ritsu:
I'm back!
Now, let's bust our butts to get ready for the festival!

Everyone:
Yeah!

Nodoka:
Hey!
You guys didn't submit your auditorium use permission form?!

Ritsu:
Huh?

Yui & Ritsu & {Font color|#387f9c|Jun}} & Azusa:
Ahh!

Ritsu:
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

Student Council Staff:
A deadline is a deadline, you know.

Ritsu:
Could you bend the rules?

Nodoka:
I'd like to appeal on their behalf.
They missed submission deadline because the club president was home sick with a cold.
Please make it an exception?!

Student Council Staff:
Well, if you feel this strongly, Miss Manabe...
You have until the end of the day.

Everyone:
Ah!

Ritsu:
Oh… Oh, you...
You're a good egg, ain'tcha!
Please look after Mio!
And please, while you're at it, you can look after me from now on, too, right?

Mio:
So, what's wrong with Pure Pure?

Ritsu:
Rejected.

Yui:
How about Clenched Fist?

Ritsu:
Too balladry.

Yui:
How about "Gum On the Sole of My Shoe"?

Ritsu:
You stepped in some, didn't you?

Yui:
Oh! How did you know?

Ritsu:
Mugi, don't you have any good ones?

Tsumugi:
How about something like Recharging Time?

Ritsu:
Sounds like bad luck!

Mio:
How about Popcorn Honeymoon?

Ritsu:
Oh! Come on, guys, what's with all these silly cutesy names?

Yui:
What do you think of Rocket Pencil?

Ritsu:
Could you hush?

Sawako:
God, this is annoying!
I can't even enjoy a nice cup of tea!
For stuff like this, just pick something at random!
All done!

Everyone:
Eh! She decided it on her own!

Ritsu:
What the heck.

Everyone:
All Right!
We've settled on a band name!

Azusa:
All that's left for us now is to practice hard for the School Festival concert.

Yui:
Achoo!

Everyone:
Maybe not...

Preview

Azusa:
So, her fever hasn't gone down yet...

Ui:
No.
If this keeps up tomorrow, the show is in danger.

Ritsu:
Getting sick at a time like this just shows her lack of dedication!

Mio:
You're the one who gave it to her!

Ritsu:
Oh, I did?

Ui:
Oh, Big Sis!

Sawako:
You may fool the others, but you can't fool me.
Yui:
Wow, you sure have thick eyebrows, Mugi-chan!

Tsumugi:
Yes. But they're actually... takuan pickles!

Yui:
Ahhh.
Wow, they're delicious!

Tsumugi:
What's delicious

Yui:
Takuan...

Ui:
A priest

Ui:
Looks like your fever's still really high...

Yui:
Sigh... Oh, that's right... I have a bad cold. Achoo!
Ui...

Ui:
Here. Blow.

Yui:
Thanks a lot, Ui...

Ui:
I'll let the school know that you're sick.

Yui:
I'm sorry...
You'd better hurry up, you're gonna be late.

Ui:
Oh, there's ice cream and mandarin orange jelly in the fridge.

Yui:
Wow, you left me a feast! Thanks a lot, Ui...

Ui:
If you need anything, call my cell.

Yui:
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

OP

Azusa:
So, her fever still hasn't come down...

Ui:
No. She'll probably have to stay home tomorrow, too.

Azusa:
There's only four days left...

Ui:
I'd gladly trade places with her if I could.
By getting her cold to move to me.

Azusa:
How would you move her cold to you

Ui:
I don't know... Oral transmission

Azusa:
She's daring...

Ritsu:
Greetings!

Mio:
Don't spook the underclassmen!



Mio:
She is

Ritsu:
No excuse!
Getting sick at a time like this just shows her lack of dedication!

Mio:
You're the one who gave it to her!

Ritsu:
Huh Oh, I did

Azusa:
Yes, you did!
I mean look at the timing of it!

Ui:
Ah, she probably caught it the other day...

Sawako
I want you to pick your stage outfits from these!

Ritsu:
You're forcing us to!

Azusa:
When did she have time to make all these

Sawako
Pick anything you like!
How about this waitress outfit, isn't it cute

Tsumugi:
What can I get for you today

Mio:
No way!
That's even worse!
That's... not bad, actually.
Miss Yamanaka, I think I'm really starting to enjoy this.

Sawako
Isn't it fun

Ritsu:
[Where did you going]

Yui:
You guys, look at this!

Azusa:
Hey, how about we all wear these

Yui:
These are so cute!

Tsumugi:
Oh, they are! They look easy to move in, too!

Mio:
I guess these aren't so bad.

Yui:
C'mon, these are great!
Let's wear these!
Let's wear these!
Let's wear these!
Let's wear these...

Ui:
Sis was crazy about her yukata.
So much so that she wore hers all day long, and that might be the reason why she caught a bad cold.

Ritsu:
What is she too.

Azusa:
Sounds like Yui-senpai, all right.

Ritsu:
Yeah, well, I gotta admit that at the time I was thinking that those outfits were pretty awesome, too.

Azusa:
You know, when you think about them rationally, they're actually kind of embarrassing.

Ritsu:
You agreeJun & Mio:

Mio:
Azusa. Would you mind practicing all the lead guitar part starting today

Ritsu:
You think that Yui might not get better in time

Azusa:
But I--

Mio:
Look, it's just so we can be prepared for the worst.
See you after school.

Ritsu:
Later.

Ui:
I'm sorry...

Azusa:
Mm.

Yui:
Seconds, please...

Ui:
I'm home.

Ui:
Oh, poor Sis...

Yui:
Yum!

Mio:
Azusa, can you handle it

Azusa:
Yes, I think so.

Mio:
All right. Then, let's run through it one more time from the top.

Azusa:
Sure.

Yui:
Hey there!

Mio:
Ah, you're here!

Azusa:
Senpai!

Tsumugi:
Are you over your cold

Yui:
Huh My cold

Azusa:
That's awfully forced...

Mio:
Well, I guess that means you're feeling fine, then.

Ritsu:
If you were feeling better, then you should've come into school this morning!
All of us were pretty worried about you!

Yui:
Huh Oh, that! Right! I suddenly felt better after classes had already ended!

Ritsu:
You just wanted to skip school.

Azusa:
That's not important, let's just start practicing, right

Yui:
Yeah, sure, why not.

Yui:
How's that

Everyone
Huh

Mio:
What do you think

Tsumugi:
I'm not certain, but--

Ritsu:
Maybe it was just a fluke.

Mio:
Maybe you're right.
Let's try it one more time.

Tsumugi:
I agree.

Mio:
Yui.

Yui:
Yes

Mio:
Our sound is way too tight!
It's never ever felt like that before!

Ritsu:
All of a sudden, you're playing way too on the beat! What happened

Yui:
Not a thing!

Tsumugi:
The moon's turned to blood...

Azusa:
So, what's the problem
If our sound is tight, that's a good thing!
If you ask me, that's the best we've ever played.

Yui:
Yeah, yeah!
I think we should listen to Azusa!

Tsumugi:
Guess you're right.

Ritsu:
I suppose we were just thrown for a loop.

Yui:
Miss Ritsu, you and Miss Tsumugi just worry too much.

Ritsu:
Miss Ritsu:

Tsumugi:
Miss Tsumugi:

Sawako
It's time you dropped the masquerade... Ui-chan.

Ritsu:
When did you--!

Everyone
Ui-chan!

Sawako
You may be able to fool others, but you can't fool me.
Your boobs are bigger than Yui-chan's!

Yui:
I-I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about!

Azusa:
Okay, call me by my nickname, then.

Yui:
A-Azusa #2!

Azusa:
An imposter!

Ui:
I'm so sorry.

Mio:
Well, I have to admit you were a dead ringer for Yui. I had no idea.

Tsumugi:
I didn't know that you could play the guitar, Ui-chan.

Ui:
I can't. But Sis let me hold it a few times.

Yui:
Oh, I see, so that's how you play it!

Ui:
Yeah, It's written right here!

Everyone
Why am I not surprised

Ritsu:
You know, we might be better off if Yui just stayed home and we let Ui play.

Mio:
Ritsu.

Ui:
I should apologize to you, too.

Azusa:
Sure.

Ui:
See, when I saw my sister lying there in bed, I couldn't just stand there and do nothing.

Yui:
Hey there...

Ritsu:
Oh, serious deja vu!

Azusa:
Senpai!

Yui:
Sorry I made you guys worried about me.

Tsumugi:
Are you feeling better

Yui:
I am! When I woke up a little while ago, I was feeling a lot better than before.
I'd hoped to get in a little practice-- Achoo!

Ritsu:
Gross!

Yui:
Honest, I'm all better!

Ritsu:
You're a liar.
I need a tissue, too.

Yui:
Oh, Geeta! So that's where you've been!
Come here! Oh, you're heavy!

Ui:
Oh, Sis!

Yui:
Let me make chicken soup with them next time...

Mio:
Hey, your fever hasn't gone down at all!

Yui:
I'm sorry...
I guess I won't make it.
Maybe you'd all be better off playing without me.

Tsumugi: Nonsense!

Yui:
Azu-nyan, you take lead guitar for me, okay

Azusa:
No way.

Tsumugi:
Azusa...

Azusa:
I said no! If we all can't play together, I'd rather just cancel the show!

Mio:
Azusa, wait!
Yui. Don't come to the club until the show.

Yui:
You're kicking me out

Mio:
No. I'm ordering you to stay home and rest, so you can completely get over your cold.
And then we'll ALL play the show together.
Don't you dare give up until then. Got it

Yui:
Mio-chan...

Mio:
And I want you to practice the lead part, too, Azusa.
Not just for when Yui's gone, but for the future of our band.

Azusa:
Senpai...

Mio:
For now, let's do everything we can to get ourselves ready for the show.

Ui:
Okay, good night.

Yui:
Good night.

Yui:
I'm gonna sleep a lot. I'm gonna sleep as much as I can!
I'm gonna get better in time for the show!



Tsumugi:
Yui still isn't here...

Azusa:
Call her cell

Tsumugi:
She sent a message saying that she would be here no matter what.

Mio:
But it's already 1230.

Ritsu:
Do you wanna rehearse
The versions without Yui's parts.

Mio:
I guess we have to.

Azusa:
No!
Don't you see we can't do that! There's no point in practicing if Yui-senpai isn't here with us.

Nodoka:
What's the matter
I've pushed back your set 10 minutes,
but please be at the auditorium at 1PM as scheduled.

Mio:
Understood.

Nodoka:
I see that all club members are present
Light Music Club all participants are present and ready... Good.

Mio:
Nodoka:

Nodoka:
One time...

Yui:
Oh no, buckets are full...

Nodoka:
Yui-chan

TV
We'll use this.
Is that really safe

Nodoka's Mother
Yui-chan, it's nice to see you again.

Nodoka:
Ah! Ugh! Eeeeek!

Ritsu:
What the heck

Azusa:
She's been strange all her life, hasn't she

Tsumugi:
But what's the point of that story

Nodoka:
That when Yui is focused on something, she loses sight of everything else.
I'm sure that she'll forget about her cold. That's why I know she--

Sawako
'Sup, girls!

Ritsu:
Way to ruin the moment!
More to the point, where the heck have you been
We're having a crisis here!

Sawako
Well, I can now show you that I haven't been spending my time doing nothing.
I factored in the temperature outside and made the stylish cold-weather version of those yukata!

Everyone
I wish you'd focus that enthusiasm someplace else.

Sawako
And so without further ado!

Yui:
Excuse me for being late...

Ritsu:
Yui!

Mio:
You should've come to the club room first!

Yui:
Sorry about that.
A-Azu-nyan

Azusa:
That was so mean! Here we were worried about you, and you--
It was so mean!

Mio:
You'd better make amends. Azusa was more worried about you than any of us.

Yui:
Huh She was
Azu-nyan!

Azusa:
What you did was terrible! For one thing, when you have a cold, you--

Yui:
Glomp! I didn't mean to worry you.
Sorry Azu-nyan.
I'll give it everything I've got.
Together with all you guys, okay
We'll make this the best show ever.

Azusa:
Geez.
Okay, just this once.

Yui:
Now, come on, let's kiss and make up!

Yui:
You think that Azu-nyan was really worried about me

Mio:
I guess.

Nodoka:
All right, it's time, girls. Time to get going.

Everyone:
Yeah!

Yui:
Wait a sec. Where's Geeta

Ritsu:
Huh

Yui:
I left him here, didn't I

Ritsu:
Oh, I think Ui-chan took it home with her.

Ui:
Sis I'm gonna leave the guitar right here.

Yui:
Sure... Thanks a lot, Ui...

Yui:
Oh my gosh, she did!
What do I do!

Sawako:
Guess we have no choice...

Yui:
Miss Yamanaka

Sawako:
Here. Use this one.

Ritsu:
Do you mind playing a different guitar

Yui:
Actually, I CAN'T play any guitar except Geeta!

Everyone:
There's a shock...

Yui:
Whoaahh!

Ui:
Aha. Wow, it's packed already!
I'll just stand.

Jun:
Hi, Ui-chan

Ui:
Huh There you are!

Announcement:
And now, get ready for a performance by After-school Teatime of the Light Music Club.

Ui:
Oh no, where's Sis

Ritsu:
One, two, three!


Yui:
I found it!
I have to hurry!
Come to think of it, I ran down this road the day of the entrance ceremony, too.
I was thinking, I've gotta do something! as I ran.
And also What am I going to do
And Is this really how I'm gonna grow up

Yui:
Listen up, me...
The me of that day, you don't have to worry.
You'll find it soon enough.
You'll find something that you can do.
Something that you can lose yourself in.
And a place that...
A place that...
A place that means more than anything to you!

Ui:
Oh, Big Sis!

Yui:
Ui!
Peace!

Ui:
Big Sis, you can do it!

Yui:
Yeah!

Yui:
Miss Yamanaka, thanks a lot!

Sawako:
All right, ladies, knock 'em dead.

Student:
Miss Yamanaka, you're awesome!

Yui:
I really am sorry, you guys.
Now that I think about it, I'm always causing trouble for you...
And it's always at important times like this!

Mio:
You should at least tie your tie.

Ritsu:
We all think you're the greatest, Yui.

Student:
You can do it, Yui!
Go get them, Yui!

Yui:
Um, once again, we're After-school Teatime.
I'm sorry to all of you. I was so late today because I left my guitar at home.
Sorry I forgot you, Geeta.

Ui:
That's why!

Yui:
When we started the Light Music Club, we said that our slogan was gonna be Budokan or bust!
We worked after-school jobs together so I could buy Geeta, we had tea in the club room together and talked about everything.
We had training camps at Mugi-chan's summer house, and looked for a new student who would join the club.
I can't really say that we devoted ourselves wholeheartedly to practicing,
but right now, for us standing here on the stage, this auditorium is our Budokan!
And we'll sing our hearts out to the very end!
Fuwa Fuwa Time, guys!

Yui:
One more time!

Yui:
I love light music!
Ritchan, let's do another one!

Ritsu:
You got it!

Nodoka:
Yui!

Yui:
Nodoka-chan!

Nodoka:
Your time is up!

Yui:
Huhhhh

Preview

Yui:
What about a marshmallow soy milk hot pot or a chocolate curry hot pot

Mio:
Let's see...

Ritsu:
Uh, it's nothing!
Check it!
Moustache!

Tsumugi:
I have to... bow out today.

Yui:
Do you have plans

Tsumugi:
Um, sort of...
Bye!
Mio:
Let's see...

Yui:
It sure is cold today, huh, Ui?

Ui:
Yeah.

OP

Yui:
I'm freezing!
It's so cold!
Ritchan, aren't you cold?

Ritsu:
Oh, yes, it is most frigid, indeed!

Yui:
Yes, indeed it is!
Huh? Ritchan!
Whack!
Wow, your cheeks are really warm, Ritchan!

Ritsu:
What's the big idea?!
All right, then!

Yui:
Oh, it was cold!


Yui:
Oh, it's so cold I can't play Geeta!
I've got a great idea!
I'll try playing with my gloves on!

Ritsu:
Yeah, that's gonna work...

Yui:
I'm ready!
Here we go...
Let's see.
I can't hold the pick!
Oh, they're catching on the strings!
You're bad gloves!

Mio:
Wasn't it obvious?
Right, Ritsu?
Ritsu?
Ritsu, is something the matter?

Yui:
Ritchan?
Ritchan?

Ritsu:
Huh?

Yui:
What's the matter?

Ritsu:
Uh, it's nothing!
Check it!
Moustache!

Yui:
Ritchan, that's sneaky!
I'll try it, too! Moustache!

Ritsu:
Wrong! That looks nothing like a moustache!

Yui:
Like this, Senpai?

Yui:
Handy!
I'm sorry I got mad at you!

Azusa:
You named your gloves, too?

Yui:
You know, I think this is all winter's fault!

Azusa:
Oh, come on, you shouldn't blame winter.

Yui:
You know what, I think you're right.
There's lots of fun thing for us to do on cold winter days!
I know! Come to my place on Sunday for a hot pot party!
Huh?

Tsumugi:
I'm sorry, but I already have plans that day.

Ritsu:
Me, too.
I told my kid brother that I'd take him out to the movies on Sunday.

Azusa:
And I don't think that I'll be able to leave the house at all this weekend.

Yui:
What about you, Mio-chan?

Mio:
I can't come over, either. I wanna write some new lyrics this weekend.

Yui:
Aw...

Mio:
Sorry, but you and Ritsu are always bothering me, so I can never concentrate when I'm here.
See?

Yui & Jun & Ritsu:
We apologize for being insensitive!

Yui:
Oh, well then, I guess it'll just be me, Ui, and Geeta for the party.

Azusa:
Try not to get you guitar dirty, okay?
Don't forget you just had it worked on recently.

Yui:
That won't be a problem. I'm gonna put a bib on him before he eats!

Azusa:
Guess that's all right, then.

Yui:
You gotta have a hot pot party in the winter?

Yui:
It's full-on winter now, huh, Ritchan?
These Gloveys that I got from Ui are all nice 'n warm!

Ritsu:
That kid sure has her act together.
I wish I had a sister like her.
I'm Tsumugi: with jealousy, you know!

Tsumugi:
Um... Wait!

Yui:
Yeah, what's up, Mugi-chan?

Tsumugi:
I have to bow out today.

Yui:
Do you have plans?

Tsumugi:
Um, sort of.
Bye!

Yui:
Gee, I wonder what's up with Mugi-chan?
Think she's going to meet up with someone?

Azusa:
With a boyfriend, maybe?

Yui:
Whoa, I can see how Mugi-chan would be popular with the boys!

Azusa:
Yeah!

Ritsu:
Later!

Yui:
See you next week!

Azusa:
I'm off!

Azusa:
Senpai?

Yui:
Yes, what?

Azusa:
Sorry, but I have to go buy something by the station on the way home.

Yui:
Oh, what'cha gonna buy?

Azusa:
Um. Just some toys, nothing special.

Yui:
Oh, some toys?
Maybe I'll tag along...

Azusa:
No, it's fine! You don't have to go!
I'll just see you later.

Yui:
Bye, Azusa!

Mio:
Ritsu... About that thing the other day.
Ritsu?

Ritsu:
Huh? You say something?

Mio:
What's the matter?

Ritsu:
Nothing at all!
Gosh, it sure is cold, isn't it?
I'm starving, Mio!

Mio:
Hm?

Clerk:
Thank you, come again!

Yui:
Nothing beats a piping hot meat bun!

Ritsu:
Oww, freezing!
So cold...

Jun:
Azusa, could you please look after my family's cat this weekend?
My aunt was supposed to watch her, but she came down with a cold and has to stay in bed.
She's still just a kitten, so I'm worried about leaving her alone.

Azusa:
But I've never taken care of a cat.

Jun:
Oh. I should have known...

Azusa:
But if there's no one else that you can ask...

Jun:
Really?!

Azusa:
Wanna play?

Cat:
Meow.

Clerk:
Go ahead.

Tsumugi:
Um. All right!
I did it!

Clerk:
Okay, let's start off with the cleaning.

Tsumugi:
Right! I'm eager to learn!

Ui:
Hey, Sis!
C'mon, get out of bed!
Sis!

Ritsu:
"On winter days, I am happy no matter how cold it is."
"When I see you running towards me, panting out white puffs of breath,"
"...your neatly-trimmed hair suits you well."
"But then again I'd also like to see you with your bangs hanging down."
Looks goofy...

Satoshi:
Hey, Sis, you ready yet?!

Ritsu:
I'll be right there! Geez.

Cat:
Meow...

Azusa:
You're Azu-nyan #2.

Tsumugi:
Allow me to read your order back to you.
You ordered one cheeseburger with everything and two medium colas, is that right, sir?

Clerk:
Don't forget to smile!

Tsumugi:
And sir, would you be wanting fries with that order?

Customer:
Sure, I'll take some fries, too.

Tsumugi:
Thank you very much, sir!

Clerk:
Just like that.

Tsumugi:
Right!

Mio:
Right... I'll get some killer lyrics here!

Ui:
Oh, no one's coming?

Yui:
No.

Ui:
Oh, that's too bad.

Yui:
Hey, I know. Why don't we invent some new hot pot recipes today!
For the next time everybody comes over!

Ui:
That's awfully forward-thinking of you, Sis!

Yui:
What about a marshmallow soy milk hot pot or a chocolate curry hot pot?

Ui:
Maybe we shouldn't fly too high too fast, okay, sis?

Yui:
Huh? Who knows, they just might taste good!

Ui:
Sis, why don't we buy some strawberry milk today?

Yui:
Whoa! Ui, you're so generous!



Mio:
It's cold!
Lyrics aren't coming to me at all. Maybe I should've gone to Yui's hot pot party.
But it sounded like everybody else already had plans...
I wonder what everyone's up to?

Satoshi:
It's freezing!
I thought we were having a global warming crisis!

Ritsu:
Dummy, it's supposed to be cold in the winter.
You know, you're such a wimp. I wish all the girls in your class could see you now.

Satoshi:
Come on, cut me some slack, Sis...

Ritsu:
Oh, wait.

Satoshi:
What?

Ritsu:
Whack!
Nice 'n warm!

Satoshi's Friend:
Hey, Tainaka!
How's it going?

Ritsu:
Oh, hello.
Cold, isn't it?

Satoshi's Friend:
I'm on my way over to Suzuki's house.
Wanna come?

Satoshi:
Yeah, sure!
Can I, please, Sis?

Ritsu:
Um... Yeah, just don't stay out too late.

Satoshi's Friend:
See you later!

Satoshi's Friend:
Where did you go?

Satoshi:
To see a movie.

Satoshi's Friend:
How was it?

Satoshi:
That was pretty good, I guess.

Tsumugi:
Thank you for waiting, Miss!

Customer:
I-I'm sorry, but I ordered hot coffee, not a big soft drink.

Tsumugi:
I'm sorry, I'll exchange it right aw...

Clerk:
Oh, sorry!

Tsumugi:
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

Clerk:
It's okay, don't worry.
What drink did you need?

Tsumugi:
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

Azusa:
Oh, no! What's the matter?! What is it?!
Azu-nyan #2!

Ritsu:
Was that...
Was that really... a love letter?

Mio:
Maybe I should go home...

Tsumugi:
I messed up... I thought I could do it, but I messed up!

Azusa:
What should I do...?
What should I do?

Yui:
Which hot pot would you rather try, marshmallow soy milk or chocolate curry?

Mio:
Huh?

Ritsu:
That's a hot pot?

Tsumugi:
Strange!

Yui:
Boy, that's weird, nobody's answering...

Yui:
Oh, it's Azu-nyan!
Hello there, Azu-nyan?

Azusa:
Please don't send out weird texts at a time like this!

Yui:
A time like what?

Azusa:
It's the kitten! It's this cat that a friend asked me to look after!

Yui:
What's wrong with it?

Azusa:
I really have no idea, but something seems to be wrong with her.
And nobody's at home right now, and I... and I-I don't know what to do!

Yui:
Understood! Try to stay calm, Azu-nyan, we'll be right there!

Azusa:
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to cause a fuss.

Yui:
I'm just glad that nothing's wrong with Azu-nyan #2.

Azusa:
I had no idea that cats threw up hairballs all the time.

Yui:
Open wide!
For you, Azu-nyan!
I guess they might taste better when you eat them as they are.

Azusa:
Of course they do!

Yui:
Oh, look! I've got texts from the rest of the guys!
Whoa! Mugi-chan has a job?!
Oh, Mio-chan went all the way out to the beach!
Ritchan wants to know where we are.
"We're at Azu-nyan's place."

Tsumugi:
How can I help you?

Yui:
What a surprise! Mugi-chan started work at a real job!

Ritsu:
Our Mugi sure is growing up!

Yui:
Yep!

Ritsu:
Azusa!

Ui:
Did Jun come over and get her cat from you already?

Azusa:
Mm-hm.

Yui:
That's really good news.

Ritsu:
So, I got that you spent your day cat-sitting.

Yui:
Oh, Mio-chan, welcome back!

Ritsu:
Write anything good?
Looks like that's a "no", huh?

Yui:
But, that's kinda cool, though, jetting off to a windswept winter beach like that!
You guys are so awesome! Don't grow up and leave me behind, okay?
You haven't changed at all, right, Ritchan?

Ritsu:
I have, too, changed!

Yui:
What? What did you change?

Ritsu:
Just forget about it, it's nothing.

Mio:
Oh, that reminds me, Ritsu.

Ritsu:
Reminds you?

Mio:
What did you think of those lyrics that I left in your mailbox. Did you like them?

Ritsu:
Huh? Lyrics?

Mio:
Yeah. I tried writing them all out on my computer this time.

Ritsu:
Then... You were the one who left them?

Mio:
Huh? Yeah.

Ritsu:
You wrote that stuff?!
That was you?!

Mio:
I TOLD you I was gonna leave it in your mailbox!

Ritsu:
Don't do old-fashioned stuff like that in this day and age!

Yui:
Oh, come on, Ritchan, let's eat our hamburgers before they get cold.
'Kay?

Tsumugi:
Thank you very much for coming, Miss!

Yui:
Hey, what's the matter, Mio-chan?

Mio:
Well, my bass is still really cold, and when it touched my thigh, I just--

Yui:
Oh, do it again!
It was really cute!

Mio:
Forget it.
You never seem to have any problems playing your keyboard, do you, Mugi?

Yui:
Don't your hands get numb from the cold?

Tsumugi:
Well, no, they're just fine.

Yui:
They're so warm!

Ritsu:
Let me see!

Mio:
Wow, you're right!

Tsumugi:
I've always had a high body temperature.

Yui:
You're so lucky! I wish we could install one of you at our house!
Azu-nyan, you should come here and feel this!

Azusa:
No thanks, I'll pass.

Yui:
She really is warm!

Tsumugi:
Here!

Azusa:
Oh, I suppose if you insist...
Wow, you're right, they're really warm!

Yui:
You know, your hands are so tiny and cute, Azu-nyan!

Mio:
And I'm just a simple girl with man hands and a cold heart...

Yui:
Are you still hung up on that?!
They said that people with cold hands have warm hearts, Mio-chan.

Ritsu:
Mugi, what are you doing?

Yui:
Mugi-chan, your hands and heart are BOTH really warm!

Yui:
This is so warm!

Azusa:
Yeah, this is nice and warm...

Yui:
Winter is not so bad.

Azusa:
Mugi-senpai, how long do you plan to keep working?

Tsumugi:
At least until new years.

Yui:
We'll visit you at work again, okay?

Ritsu:
Mio, we're NEVER using those lyrics you gave me, got it?

Mio:
What? But why not?!

Yui:
Hey, do you think it costs lots of money to rent the Budokan?

Azusa:
Wait a minute, you wanna rent it?!

Yui:
Well, if we don't, we can't play a big show there, right?

Tsumugi:
It's best to have big dreams.

Ritsu:
We'll stand on that stage some day!

Mio:
Well, we'd better practice a lot more, then.

Azusa:
That's right!
We have to practice!
And we'll never play there if we don't go pro.

Ritsu:
You two are hardcore realists, aren't you?

Yui:
I, for one, am gonna work hard, Ritchan!

Tsumugi:
Let's all work hard!

Everyone:
Yeah!

Preview

Yui:
A live house?

Ritsu:
Yeah, yeah!
An old friend of mine from back in middle school invited us to come and play a show there.

Yui:
Oh!

Mio:
This says here that the show is on New Year's Eve.
That's only ten days from now.

Azusa:
But we really don't have anything ready.

Yui:
Aw, but it sounds like fun!
I'd really love to give it a shot!

Ritsu:
Me too!

Yui:
Geeta, let's do our best together tomorrow, okay?
I just know this is gonna be a lot of fun.
Yui:
A live house?

Ritsu:
Yeah, Yeah! An old friend of mine from back in middle school invited us to come and play a show there.

Yui:
Oh!

Mio:
This says here that the show is on New Year's Eve.
That's only ten days from now.

Azusa:
But we really don't have anything ready.

Yui:
Aw, but it sounds like fun!
I'd really love to give it a shot!

Ritsu:
Me too!

Yui:
Mm-hm.

Mio:
I don't know if I can handle playing in front of a big crowd again...

Ritsu:
Mio! You know, if you keep talking like that, you're never gonna grow as a musician!

Yui:
You look really cool when you play your bass, Mio.

Mio:
Well, then, let's decide it by majority rule.
Who wants to pass on the show?

Azusa:
Ritsu-senpai, Yui-senpai, I'm sorry.

Ritsu:
Huh! Such impudence!
All those in favor of playing!

Yui:
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

Tsumugi:
Yes!

Azusa:
Mugi-senpai?!

Mio:
But, Mugi, I thought you had a big trip plan for the end of the year.

Tsumugi:
Yes, but an opportunity like this doesn't come along very often.
And besides... I really think it would be absolutely wonderful for all of us to play a big show together on the very last day of the year.

Mio:
Mugi...
She has a point...

Azusa:
I can't disappoint Mugi-senpai.

Azusa:
Um...

Mio:
We change our votes to "yes."

Ritsu:
Sweet! That settles it, we're playing a show!

Yui:
Yahoo!

Ritsu:
We're in it to win it!

Yui:
And that is how we all decided to play our first show together at a real live house.
I'm so excited!

OP

Yui:
He's so cute!
Christmas is just around the corner, isn't it?

Ritsu:
C'mon, let's go.

Yui:
Coming!

Yui:
Whoa! So this is a live house, huh?

Tsumugi:
I'm nervous for some reason.

Yui:
Y-Yeah...

Ritsu:
Hey, now, don't sweat it!
Hello? Anybody here?

Kawakami:
Just minute!
Yes, can I help you?

Ritsu:
Um, well, we've come to apply to play the big show!
We're After-school Teatime!

Kawakami:
Oh, I've heard good things about you. Love Crisis' Maki-chan referred you, right?

Yui:
Love Crisis?
Oh, man, They have a really cool name!
Hey, Ritchan, doesn't our band name seem a little bit too warm and fuzzy compared to theirs?

Kawakami:
After-school Teatime, huh?
What a cute name. I like it.

Yui:
She complimented us on it!



Ritsu:
So, that's what we sound like...

Kawakami:
Hm, all right, then, would you mind filling out this application form?

Ritsu:
Okay!

Kawakami:
Let's see... On the day of the show, you have to arrive at 1PM.

Ritsu:
Wow, that's pretty early...

Kawakami:
Because of rehearsals.
Each band will get 15 minutes.
Meeting at 3PM. Doors open at 4PM. Show starts at 5PM. Got it?

Ritsu:
Um, Sure!

Kawakami:
Also, (as for what gear you'll be bringing,
...you'll need to fill out a basic itemized list beforehand.
You can fill that out later.)

Ritsu:
Even if I forget, I'm sure the guys will--
Ow!

Mio:
So this is a ticket for our show...

Yui:
Wow, I guess you have to pay to be let in...

Ritsu:
They're not listening!

Kawakami:
Come on, I'll show you around the club.
This is the dressing room.

Yui:
Dressing room?!
Wow, this is?!

Tsumugi:
Excuse me, would it be all right if we put up a shop curtain?
Come in!

Yui:
Whoa! That would be so cool, Mugi-chan!

Tsumugi:
Wouldn't it, though?

Kawakami:
You know, all of the other bands will be using the room, too...
And this door leads to the stage.

Everyone:
Whoa!

Yui:
Oh, look, there's even a disco ball!

Kawakami:
You need to think about what sort of lighting setup you want for your numbers.

Yui:
It needs to be all swirly and sparkly and shiny and fun!

Azusa:
We're really going to be playing here, aren't we?

Tsumugi:
It's exciting, isn't it?

Ritsu:
Don't burn yourself out yet.

Kawakami:
We look forward to having you for the show!

Everyone:
Yes, thank you very much!

Ui:
Huh? You're playing at a live house?

Yui:
Yeah, we're on our way to have a meeting there up to this.

Ui:
Ah, that's amazing!

Yui:
Heh-heh-heh...

Ritsu:
So, we have a four-song set,
"Stapler," "Brush Pen," "Curry," and "Fuwa Fuwa Time."

Yui:
Ah, what should we wear?

Ritsu:
How about what we wore to our first School Festival?

Azusa:
Uh... Those frilly things?

Yui:
Don't worry, I'm sure Miss Yamanaka wouldn't mind making one for you!

Ritsu:
Miss Yamanaka made some other outfits for us, too...
Nurse, school swimsuit, frilly Lolita...

Azusa:
No way!

Ritsu:
Why don't we have her make something new, then.

Yui:
How about something like transforming fighter outfits?!

Tsumugi:
Oh, adorable!
You mean like magical girls?

Mio:
Why not just wear our uniforms?

Azusa:
I vote for uniforms!

Yui:
That's a great idea!
Oh, right!
Here! Tickets for you and Jun-chan.
Come watch us play, okay?

Ui:
Commemorative tickets to my sister's first take show...
It almost seems like a waste to use them.

Azusa:
You can't get in if you don't.

Yui:
Let's see, I still have to give one to Nodoka-chan.
Here, this is for you!

Nodoka:
Wow, you're playing a live show?
That's amazing.

Yui:
Heh-heh-heh...
You'd better hurry and get all our autographs now before we make it really big!

Nodoka:
Oh, that's okay, Yui.

Yui:
But I already made one for you...

Mio:
You jumped the gun.

Nodoka:
In that case, I'll take it.

Yui:
Oh, thank you, Nodoka-chan!
Let's see, now we need to give one to Miss Yamanaka.

Ritsu:
There's a poster!

Yui:
I can't believe we're gonna be in this show.
Wonder what other kinds of bands will be playing?

Azusa:
Mio-senpai?

Ritsu:
Mio's kinda shy, that's all.

Ui:
Sis! I'm gonna take a bath first, okay?

Yui:
'Kay!
Geeta, let's do our best together tomorrow, okay?
I just know this is gonna be a lot of fun!

Fan:
Have a great show!

Yui:
Huh?

Ritsu:
Will do!

Yui:
Do you think they play in one of the other bands or something?

Ritsu:
No, I'm pretty sure that they're fans.

Yui:
Oh, we've got fans already?!
Hi, everyone!

Ritsu:
It's nice to meet you all!

Yui:
Everyone seems like they're really hardcore...

Band Member:
Hey there, how are you doing?

Band Member:
How's it going?

Band Member:
Nice to meet ya.

Yui:
They were nice and said hello!

Maki:
Yo, Ritchan! You, too, Mio, it's been forever!

Ritsu:
Good to see you, Maki!
Let me introduce you, guys.
This is my friend Maki, drummer for Love Crisis.
She's the one who sent us the invite to play!

Maki:
Nice to meet ya.

Yui:
The pleasure's all ours! Thank you for looking after our Ritchan!

Aya:
Oh, ha ha, heh heh, It's Mio!

Maki:
This is Aya, our bassist.
She's a big fan of yours, Mio.

Aya:
You were completely awesome at the School Festival show!

Yui:
Oh, you came to see us play?

Aya:
Yeah, you're the one who came late!

Yui:
I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry!

Aya:
It's okay, it was a fun show!

Aya:
Um... Is she okay?

Ritsu:
Hm, sorry, it's 'cause we don't get complemented on our performances by strangers very often.
I think.

Aya:
Well, that explains it.
Oh, that's right! Make sure you come see us at our next show, okay?

Maki:
Our next one's gonna be a solo gig.

Tsumugi:
Goodness...

Aya:
Oh, and have a CD!
It's homemade, but still...

Yui:
This is amazing!

Maki:
Gotta go! Talk to you later!

Ritsu:
Sure!
Their enthusiasm is on a whole other level...

Yui:
Hey, you know, we really ought to have a logo or something like that, too, shouldn't we?

Everyone:
Huh?

Yui:
Let's see...
Um... How about this one?

Ritsu:
That's like for a hot spring!

Yui:
It is?

Tsumugi:
Why don't you try adding a tea cup?

Yui:
Liiike this?
Whoa! It's like we're having a leisurely cup of tea!
All done!

Ritsu:
Ha! Draw one on these, too!

Tsumugi:
And on my keyboard!

Mio:
I want mine on my guitar case.

Azusa:
I'd like one on my pick.

Yui:
Great! we'll all be matching!

Kawakami:
Okay, time to go to the meeting!

Ritsu:
Oh, yeah!

Everyone:
Let's do it!



Yui:
Whoa! We're gonna be the second band to play!

Mio:
Second, huh?

Assistant:
Excuse me. Here are your backstage passes.

Mio:
Oh, thank you very much.

Ritsu:
Yeah, thank you.

Yui:
Whoa, so where do you think we should stick these?
Oh, like that!

Tsumugi:
Amazing...

Ritsu:
They're like battle-hardened veterans of the show circuit.

Yui:
And these will be the very first ones that we're gonna collect!

Azusa:
Yeah!

Yui:
Here.

Ritsu:
At show time you can't get back in here unless you have the pass stick somewhere on yourself.

Yui:
Oh, yeah, you're right!

Ritsu:
You're putting it there?!

Yui:
What?

Azusa:
It's not a patch!

Yui:
It seems like I'm playing it safe...

Ritsu:
Oh, right! Let's fill out our setup sheet!

Everyone:
Oh...

Yui:
It's got spots for everything...!

Ritsu:
Well, we've got our song names and melodies, so that's okay, but...

Yui:
What's it mean by "lighting style"?

Ritsu:
Yeah, that's a really good question.

Tsumugi:
What do you think we should put down?

Ritsu:
Hmm.

Yui:
Ah! Wait, I'll be right back!

Mio:
Why did she head straight to the scariest-looking bunch?!

Yui:
They wrote down stuff like "cheerful and happy" or "pop-style"!

Ritsu:
Hah! We'll go with something like that, then.

Mio:
Oh, wait a second!
Ours should...
It should all be pink!

Azusa:
All pink?!

Mio:
We can't?

Ritsu:
Well, we can go with a pink vibe for Fuwa Fuwa Time.

Yui:
And let's use the disco ball!

Ritsu:
Okay, we'll use it for the intros and solos.

Tsumugi:
What else?

Ritsu:
Hmm... It might be pretty cool to have them put a tight spotlight on me!

Azusa:
Hey, why put the light only on you?!
What we should do is have them light up each member of the band right as we're being introduced!

Yui:
And on Geeta, too!

Mio:
I don't want one on me!

Ritsu:
If the bassist trips, get a spot on her.

Mio:
I'm not gonna trip!

Tsumugi:
What about "acoustics style"?

Yui:
Wait! Give me a sec!
They wrote stuff like "Reverb on song 3," and "Both of the guitars" and "Boost the vocals to the max."

Ritsu:
Oh! We'll write down stuff like that, then.
Where is it that we are supposed to do our banter?

Yui:
I'll go ask!
They're done with theirs, so they said we could use it for reference if we want!

Ritsu:
Haaah! We're so sorry!

Yui:
Thank you, guys!

Mio:
She's friends with them already...

Ritsu:
She can be a force to be reckoned with.

Mio:
We can use the other bands' rehearsals as reference for us, too.

Azusa:
Wow, they use a ton of effects...

Ritsu:
They have a personal mic!
I wonder how much one of those mics costs?

Yui:
Look, look!
They sell tasty snacks!
Ritchan, they sell CDs!
Gosh, we don't have any merchandise to sell, huh, Mio-chan?
Azu-nyan, do you think we'll ever be on one of these, too?
This is amazing, Mugi-chan!

Everyone:
Come on, come on, come on...

Yui:
Look, it says "After-school Teatime" here! Check it out!

Mio:
Calm down, already, will you?

Tsumugi:
Shall we have some tea?

Ritsu:
Mugi's a force to be reckoned with, too.

Yui:
This is good...

Ritsu:
This hits the spot!

Maki:
That smells good!

Tsumugi:
If you like, please feel free to join us for tea.

Maki:
Well... If you insist.

Tsumugi:
Mm-hm.

Ritsu:
So I guess you've been in a lot of contests, huh?

Band Member:
Yeah, but we haven't managed to win any, though.

Band Member:
But we're going pro, so we're not giving up.

Maki:
That's for sure.
The instant you give up, it's all over.

Aya:
I wanna keep playing music forever.

Azusa:
Oh, wow...

Mio:
They're all in bands because they really wanna play music.

Yui:
It's kind of embarrassing that we said we were gonna play the Budokan, huh?

Mio:
Maybe it's thanks to Yui's spirit, and Mugi's grace, and everybody else that we can talk like this.
We're always opening new doors ourselves, little by little.

Assistant:
After-school Teatime!
Please start your rehearsal!

Mio:
Oh, no! We got a little TOO calm down!

Yui:
W-What do I do first?!

Ritsu:
Check your setting!

Tsumugi:
O-Of course!

Azusa:
Who are you talking to?!

Kawakami:
Okay, whenever you're ready.

Everyone:
Right!

Ritsu:
E-Everybody ready?

Yui:
Oh, yup!

Azusa:
Yes!

Tsumugi:
Good to go!

Ritsu:
Okay, Um... then. We'll start with the second chorus from Fuwa Fuwa Time, all right?

Ritsu:
Yui! Sing!

Yui:
Ah, oops!

Mio:
Yui!

Azusa:
Mio-senpai, are you--

Ritsu:
Calm down, everybody!

Band Member:
Just relax.

Aya:
Hey, just take it again from the top, all right?

Band Member:
Don't sweat it, you'll be fine!

Band Member:
You can do it!

Yui:
We have to work hard so we don't make everybody else look bad!

Azusa:
This isn't just our show.

Tsumugi:
So we have to relax and give it our best.

Mio:
After all, this door was just opened for us!

Nodoka:
Well, it ought to be somewhere right around here.

Jun:
They're all here for the show?!

Nodoka:
So many...

Ui:
I wonder Big Sis would be okay?

Yui:
Ui!

Ui:
Big Sis!

Yui:
Thank you for coming Ui and Nodoka-chan and Jun-chan.

Jun:
Looks like there's gonna be a big crowd.

Yui:
Check it out! Backstage pass!

Nodoka:
Aren't you the least bit nervous?

Yui:
Sure I am! That's why I'm eating snacks to help me unwind!
Oh, right! We'll call out your names from the stage, okay?!

Nodoka:
No, don't!
That'll just make US nervous!

Yui:
See you later!

Ui:
She's fine.
She is her usual self.

Sawako:
Sigh... Oh, man, It took forever for me to pull out my old outfits...

Kawakami:
Ah, Catherine!

Sawako:
Janice! What are you doing here?!

Kawakami:
Well, I'm the manager here at the club!
Oh, wow, It doesn't look like you've changed a single bit!

Sawako:
Oh, I've changed a lot!
For one thing, I'm the teacher of those terrific girls playing up there.

Kawakami:
You are, huh?

Yui:
Show's over!

Ritsu:
It sure is...

Sawako:
Good job, ladies.

Yui:
Miss Yamanaka!
You waited for us?

Ui:
Big Sis!
Sis, you were very very good!

Yui:
Thanks a lot, Ui.

Nodoka:
You guys really played your hearts out, didn't you?
You looked great up there.

Yui:
Thanks a lot!

Ritsu:
Look at that!

Azusa:
Yeah!

Yui:
Yeah, but we had Nodoka-chan and Ui and the others waiting out here for us.

Yui:
Thank you, guys!

Ritsu:
Yeah, thank you! Let's play together again!

Azusa:
Thanks for all your help!

Tsumugi:
Thank you very much!

Mio:
And good job!

Maki:
We'll invite you to play again!

Yui:
Have a great new year!

Sawako:
I have a tiger bikini, too, so try it on!

Azusa:
Absolutely not!

Sawako:
Why not?

Mio:
What happened to the mood?

Ui:
All right, guys, I have New Year's noodles for everyone!

Ritsu:
Those look great!

Mio:
I feel bad about swarming you like this.

Ui:
Oh, no, I don't mind at all.
For one thing...

Yui:
Yummy!

Ui:
That happy look on her face is enough to make me happy.

Yui:
Aw, I got the old maid again?

TV:
This year now has just one minute remaining!

Ritsu:
Almost time...
Mio, what kind of year did you have?

Mio:
It was packed full of great times.
Thanks to all of you.
Thank you, Ritsu.

Ritsu:
Uh... Oh, stop it, you're freaking me out!

Mio:
Huh? What do you mean freaking you out?

Ritsu:
Hey, the new year's about to begin, everybody!
They fell asleep!

TV:
Happy New Year, everybody!

Mio:
Oh, it's the new year...

Ritsu:
Hey! What's the big idea, falling asleep at a time like this?!
Mugi! Yui! Wake up, darn it!

Mio:
They're all exhausted.
But that's part of being in the Light Music Club...

Yui:
Wake up! C'mon!
C'mon, wake up, everyone!

Mio:
What? What is it?

Sawako:
Where am I?

Azusa:
What time is it?

Yui:
Let's go watch the first sunrise of the year! The first one!

Ritsu:
I'm too sleepy to go.

Yui:
What's the big idea, sleeping at a time like this?!

Mio:
Like you're one to talk?

Yui:
We left Miss Yamanaka behind, think she'll be okay?

Mio:
Ui's with her. She'll be fine.
There.

Ritsu:
It's lovely...

Yui:
Isn't it, though?
This is my secret spot.

Mio:
Okay, then...
Here goes.
A Happy New Year to all my best friends!

Everyone:
Happy New Year to you, Mio!

Yui:
Hey, Azu-nyan, how long are you gonna keep those ears on?

Azusa:
Huh...? Ughhh! Why didn't anyone tell me I still had them on!

Ritsu:
Sorry, sorry, they just looked so good on you.

Tsumugi:
They're awfully cute.

Yui:
Azu-nyan, you should be more confident.

Mio:
Oh, good grief...
Yui:
Nah-nah-nah... Hm-hm-hm...

Ritsu:
Ahh...

Yui:
Heh, I look so awesome!

Ritsu:
What are you doing?

Yui:
Huh? Working on a signature move, for our freshman reception show.

Others:
Huh?!?

Azusa:
It's just kinda weird to see you here so early.

Yui:
I set my alarm clock wrong and came to school an hour early by mistake.

Ritsu:
There's something on your face.

Yui:
Hm? Huh? Huh??? Ah, bread! Bread crumbs!

OP

Yui:
Azu-nyan! Congratulations on becoming a junior.

Azusa:
Why congratulate me for that?

Ritsu:
You know. You really don't look all that different from last year, Azusa.

Azusa:
Oh yeah! Well like you're one to talk, Ritsu-senpai.

Ritsu:
Hey, what's the big deal? I was talking about your height.

Azusa:
Then why were you looking at my bust...

Mio:
Not much has changed now that we're seniors.

Tsumugi:
I have to agree.

Ritsu:
Alright, since we're all here. How about we practice?

Yui:
Yeah!
These five people are the members of our high school's light music club. My name is Yui Hirasawa, on guitar and vocals. My favorite things are stuff that's cute or delicious. Our drummer and club president is the ever-energetic Ritsu Tainaka. On keyboard is kind-hearted and slightly spacey, Tsumugi Kotobuki. Mio Akiyama is on bass. She's level-headed, but she's also really shy and a scaredy-cat. And also on guitar is the tiny and adorable, Azusa Nakano. She's our beloved kﾅ紘ai. Azu-nyan is a junior this year. And the other four of us, we're seniors. I feel so grown-up. We all play in a band together. It's called After School Teatime. We have tea and lots of fun every day. Alrighty, then.

Yui:
I can't believe we're finally seniors. Time sure flew by.

Ritsu:
I don't get what you're so happy about.

Yui:
Aw, c'mon, Rit-chan! Can you really blame me? There's something so cool about it. So what are seniors supposed to do anyway?

Ritsu:
Learn how to set your alarm clock correctly for starters.

Yui:
Hah, (changes her voice) Rit-chan. Ol' girl, take a gander at least. What'd you think?

Ritsu:
Huh?

Yui:
Do I look like a senior? Am I giving off a new vibe?

Ritsu:
What could've possibly changed in the last two seconds?

Yui:
Hm. (shiny dinging sound)

Ritsu:
Your part! You changed sides. Huh! It's, it's... it's too hard to tell. Denied.

Yui:
I wonder what our class assignments are gonna be.

Ritsu:
Maybe you'll be off by yourself in another class again, Mio.

Mio:
A-anything but that.

Tsumugi:
It'll be alright, Mio.

Ritsu:
Huh? Goodness! What shocking development is this?

Mio:
Huh?!?

Ritsu:
Kidding. I can't see a thing.

Mio:
I wanna go home.

Yui:
Rit-chan.

Ritsu:
What?

Yui:
I'll make my way in and take a look.

Ritsu:
Ahaha, good luck!

Yui:
Pardon me, coming through.
But this means? (swallows)
Whoop. Oops. Uahh.

Others:
Uh?

Yui:
I fell down.

Ritsu:
What are you doing? Get up, Yui.

Ritsu:
Well, so what did you see?

Yui:
Hm... what do you mean? Oh, we're all gonna be in the same class together this year.

Others:
No way!

Tsumugi:
We really are?

Yui:
Yea, isn't that amazing?

Ritsu:
That's so gross. You got snot hanging from your nose.

Tsumugi:
You don't wanna go to class like that.

Ritsu:
Hey, Mio. Isn't that great? We're all together for senior year. So you don't have to...

Mio:
I'm- I'm so happy...

Ritsu:
You could at least try to pretend like you don't care.

Tsumugi:
The second time we went, we saw a lot more...

Yui:
Look, look! Nodoka's in our class too.

Ritsu:
Oh!

Nodoka:
Looks like this's gonna be a boisterous class.

Yui:
Isn't this the best class ever?

Mio:
It's like someone rigged it to keep us together.

Tsumugi:
It does. What an amazing coincidence.

Ritsu:
Wait. You don't think... Did you use your power as student council president?

Nodoka:
No, of course I didn't. No one could possibly fix it so that...

Sawako:
Alright, everyone please take your seats.

Everyone:
She could.

Sawako:
This is my very first time acting as a homeroom teacher. So even though I have my share of shortcomings, let's all have a good year.

Random girl:
How lucky, we've got Miss Yamanaka as our homeroom teacher. She's gorgeous and she seems really nice.

Ritsu:
Hey, you shouldn't let appearances deceive you. Sawa-chan is really a...

Sawako:
Miss Tainaka?

Ritsu:
Huh, ma'am?

Sawako:
Please refrain from talking in class.

Ritsu:
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean anything by it.

Ritsu:
There you are.

Sawako:
Hm?

Ritsu:
Sawa-chan, we need to talk. The five of us wanna ask you something really important. Did you have anything to do with our homeroom assignments this year?

Sawako:
Of course. I put you all in the same class.

Ritsu:
Wait, can you do that? Aren't you abusing your power?

Sawako:
So what's the problem? Aren't you happy?

Mio:
Of course we're happy, but still.

Sawako:
Besides it means I have five fewer names to memorize.

Ritsu:
Hah. That explains it.

Yui:
I absolutely love it. Thank you for doing that, Miss Yamanaka.

Sawako:
You're very welcome.

Ritsu:
Quit spazzing out, Yui.

Yui:
Huh? But I'm excited we all get to spend our final year of high school together.

Mio:
It's great that we're together, but we all need to start thinking about our future plans.

Yui:
But this means, we all go on class trips together, and do our school festival presentation together, and we can study for all our tests together. And I'll be able to copy your homework too.

Ritsu:
Ehh?

Others:
What's that last one?

Yui:
I'm so psyched to be a senior.

Sawako:
The orientation ceremony's about to start. You should get to the auditorium.

Everyone:
Yes, ma'am!

Yui:
See you later, Sawa-chan.

Yui:
Huh? Ready.
Alright for the school song.

Azusa:
Lemme at it.

Suzuki:
What are you so psyched about, Azusa?

Azusa:
I'm going to get more people to join the light music club. Yeah!

Yui:
Hmmmm...

Nodoka:
Yui?

Yui:
Ah, Nodoka-chan.

Nodoka:
What are you doing there?

Yui:
It seems like I'm one short of a dozen.

Nodoka:
So you are. Well, I'm off to the student council meeting.

Yui:
Mhm, and I'm gonna go practice for reception show right now.

Nodoka:
I hope you're able to find some new members for the club.

Yui:
Well, I don't mind too much if we don't.

Nodoka:
Do you really mean that?

Yui:
Uh-huh.

Nodoka:
But once you all graduate, Azusa will be the only one left in the club.

Yui:
Whoa you're right.

Nodoka:
You need to start thinking things through. Well, practice hard.

Yui:
Mhm. She's right. The light music club has to work hard for Azu-nyan. Yeah!

Yui:
It's so relaxing here in the club room.

Ritsu:
I know what you mean. I had the urge to come here over springbreak.

Azusa:
Yea, so did I.

Ritsu:
Okay. What's our first order of business this year?

Azusa:
To go and recruit...

Ritsu:
To eat Mugi's delicious cakes. I'm kidding. We'll get to that, I promise.

Azusa:
Geez, take this seriously, would you?

Yui:
She's right, Rit-chan. If we don't get new members, Azu-nyan's gonna be the only one left in the club next year.

Ritsu:
She's spouting serious words with a slacker pose.

Mio:
I hadn't thought of that.

Ritsu:
Still, that means you're a total lock for club's president next year. Sorta like this.

Azusa:
I- I couldn't care less about that.

Ritsu:
She thought about it.

Mio:
Just for a second.

Azusa:
Anyway, let's get to work on scouting new members right away.

Tsumugi:
She dodged it.

Yui:
She panicked and changed the subject. Oh, I forgot. I made some recruiting fliers for us.

Others:
No way!

Yui:
My sister Ui said she thought it'd be a good idea. (giggles)
Others:
Oh.

Yui:
Here.

Ritsu:
Join the light music club!

Azusa:
Why am I a pig?

Yui:
You complete the light music club sandwich.

Azusa:
Sorry, I don't get it.

Yui:
We're a club, and "club sandwiches" have bacon in 'em. Get it?

Azusa:
Fine. Whatever. Let's just hand out these fliers.

Everyone:
Join the light music club!

Tsumugi:
No one is coming.

Ritsu:
At this rate the club will be disbanded next year.

Yui:
Azu-nyan's gonna be all alone.

Azusa:
Senpaiii, I'mm soo looonelyyy.

Mio:
Eek, haahhhhhh!!! (Azusa, azusa)

Yui:
Huh? What is it? We can't let that happen.

Tsumugi:
I agree, Yui. We can't.

Yui & Tsumugi & Azusa:
President.

Ritsu:
Right! And having more members means more money in the treasury.

Yui:
Bunny, bunny!

Ritsu:
Yeah, Operation Capture New Members is now underway.

Random girl:
So anyway...

Ritsu:
Whoops... Whoa!
Random girl:
Ah... hey, are you okay?

Ritsu:
I'm sorry, but would you mind helping me to the light music clubroom?
Random girls:
Is anyone here?

Mio:
Yes?
Random girls:
Are you alright? We're here for you. Hang in there.

Ritsu:
Thanks for the help 'cause right now the light music club wants you. WELCOME!

Tsumugi:
Would you like some tea?

Yui:
Sign right here and you can join us.
Random girls:
No... no, thank you. (scream)

Tsumugi:
We have cookies.

Ritsu:
My collapse-in-the-hallway plan failed.

Yui:
No, Rit-chan. You shouldn't give up so soon.

Yui:
(speaks like a British gentleman) Sorry dearies, but do you know where the light music clubroom is?

Ritsu:
An accent?

Azusa:
What's she doing?

Ritsu:
Oh, I think she's getting directions from them.

Azusa:
I guess that's only natural.

Ritsu:
How dumb is she.

Yui:
Huh.

Ritsu:
(laughs maliciously) Next we'll go with the spy operation.

Azusa:
So the basic idea here is to join the club ourselves and see how they get new members to sign up.

Captain:
Softness overcomes hardness. Judo is the art of mastering techniques in order to hone the spirit.

Members:
Right!

Ritsu:
Oh I see. So they use pep talks. Hm?

Yui:
(sparkling) You know, I think I wanna join the Judo club.

Ritsu & Azusa:
Huh! The hunter becomes the prey.

Go club:
Go is a microcosm of the universe.

Azusa & Yui & Ritsu:
Ohh!

Tea club:
Be my guests.

Yui:
Eek. Urgh. Rit-chan, it's so bitter.

Yui:
All those clubs are really neat, huh?

Ritsu:
Yeah.

Yui:
Oh, wanna take a peek in here? Is anybody home?

Ritsu:
Greetings.

Ritsu:
It says the sweat of youth.

Azusa:
Ah, this one has a special bonus for joining.

Everyone:
Welcome to the club!

Ritsu:
Geez, it's you guys?

Tsumugi:
We've been handing out fliers. Meow!

Mio:
How did it go on your end?

Ritsu:
We didn't have much luck. You guys went out dressed like that?

Azusa:
You're very devoted.

Everyone:
Welcome to the club!

Ritsu:
It's just Sawa-chan.

Sawako:
Real nice. I was wondering, what are you gonna wear for your performance tomorrow?

Others:
Our uniforms are fine.

Sawako:
I made mini-skirt maid...

Mio:
Uniforms!

Sawako:
But they're cute.

Everyone:
Welcome to the club!

Ritsu:
Oh, it's just Nodoka.

Nodoka:
Oh, are you doing costume fittings? Look, about your live performance tomorrow.

Mio:
So, does this look okay for our setlist?

Ritsu:
Let's have a look.

Tsumugi:
Have a look.

Ritsu:
Hmm... Looks good. Mugi, when we do this song, could you have a little...

Yui:
The first time Azu-nyan heard us play was the moment that she decided that she wanted to join the club, wasn't it? I'm sure that there'll be more people this year who feel the same way that Azu-nyan did. I hope... There should be. There will be! Probably...

Ritsu:
What are you doing over there, Yui?

Yui:
Ehehehe.

Azusa:
Oh, it's almost time for us to go on.

Ritsu:
Awesome. Let's rock this show, people.

Everyone:
Yeah!

Yui:
Testing, testing. To all you new students, congratulations on starting school. Welcome, all of you!

Sawako:
Oh man, they would've looked great. (Super cute!)

Yui:
We're the light music club and our band is club After School Teatime. And we all have tea and stuff every day. It's a whole lot of fun playing music together. If you're interested, join the light music club.
Hurry, hurry!
Have they already started?
Did we miss them?

Ritsu:
Ahh, that was great. Our show this year was awesome.

Mio:
Azusa and Yui. Your guitar work was in perfect sync today.

Azusa:
Wow, you really think so?

Tsumugi:
Yes, but Yui burned up all of her energy and [just] conked out over there.

Azusa:
You can't rest now, senpai. We have to go hand out fliers.

Azusa:
No one is coming.

Mio:
Well, there's still plenty of time.

Azusa:
Yea, I guess you're right.

Tsumugi:
Are you going to hand out fliers?

Azusa:
No, the restroom.

Ritsu:
You wanna go out and hand out fliers again?

Yui:
It's really strange that no one has come to check us out. I even made the clubroom more inviting.

Azusa:
Yui-senpai, put this away!

Yui:
Huh?? That was a great idea. You're mean.

Ui:
Ah, Azusa-chan.

Jun:
Real good work.

Jun:
You still don't have any new club members?

Azusa:
Is our club really that unpopular?

Ui:
I don't think that's why.

Jun:
Yeah, you were great during your show.

Ui:
I heard a whole bunch of new students saying so.

Jun:
It probably seems like the light music club is so tightly knit that it's hard for anyone else to break into it.

Azusa:
Oh, you really think so?

Ui:
Well yeah, you guys seem like you're such good friends.

Azusa:
Yeah.

Jun:
Either that or they've gotten wind of how weird you guys are.

Ui:
How can you say that?

Jun:
I'm kidding. Wow, that omelet looks terrific, Ui.

Ui:
Want some?

Jun:
Thanks.

Mio:
Looks like we're not getting any new members today.

Ritsu:
Guess not.

Tsumugi:
I wonder why.

Ritsu:
Geez, is everybody mad at us or something?

Mio:
That can't be it.

Tsumugi:
I'm sure that things will work out. I mean they have to, right?

Ritsu:
Let's come up with our next plan of action.

Tsumugi:
Yeah.

Ritsu:
Operation Bug-Catcher.

Mio:
Operation what?

Ritsu:
Yeah. We use big butterfly nets to catch freshmen.

Mio:
C'mon, Ritsu. No one's gonna fall for that.

Yui:
Actually, I'm fine with the way things are for now.

Others:
Huh?

Yui:
For now, I want things to stay the way they are. You know, hanging out in the clubroom together like this. Well, Azu-nyan isn't here now, but drinking tea, practicing and performing together. Always the five of us.

Ritsu:
I guess you're right. We'll worry about next year next year.

Sawako:
That's fine, but a year flies by fast, you guys.

Yui:
Huh? But that's 365 whole days. Well, a few days have passed already. So Mugi-chan, what's on the menu today?

Tsumugi:
Help yourselves.

Yui:
Which flavor do you guys want?

Ritsu:
I can't decide.

Yui:
Oh, I think Azu-nyan will want the banana cream one. Let's set that one aside for her.

Ritsu:
Fine. I'll get the orange one then.

Sawako:
I'll take the chestnut.

Yui:
I call dibs on the chocolate.

Tsumugi:
Vanilla for me.

Mio:
I'll get the strawberry then.

Yui:
Wow, these look so good.
Ah, Sorry, Azu-nyan, we'll go hand out fliers right away.

Azusa:
Mugi-senpai, could I have a cup of milk tea, please? Oh, and also that banana cake. I've decided that this year I wanna keep on playing with just the five of us.

Yui:
Azu-nyan. Ha... Azu-nyan!

Azusa:
Yui-senpai. I'm gonna be even harder on you this year. Understand?

Yui:
Huh?

Azusa:
Come on, take out your guitar.

Yui:
Eh. Changed my mind. New club members. Come on!

ED

Mio:
For those reasons, we're gonna do some spring cleaning.

Yui:
Hey guys, look at what I found.

Ritsu:
Oh that case looks expensive. What sort of treasure do you think lies within? Oh.

Tsumugi:
This makes it super easy to bind up old magazines.

Azusa:
But are you sure it's okay for us to split it up among ourselves?

Ritsu:
Well, what else can we do? Sawa-chan said that we should just put it in the club fund.

Yui:
Bunny, bunny.

Ritsu:
Geez, it looks like all of the other school clubs have their new members and are getting down to work.
Ritsu:
Come on, Mugi. Let's go!

Tsumugi:
I still have to finish my journal and hand it in. So, go on ahead.

Mio:
I didn't think you were on cleaning duty today, Mugi.

Tsumugi:
Well actually,Yui was supposed to do it, but... she's been sleeping like that since lunch break.

Ritsu:
Ahh...

Nodoka:
I've been trying to wake her up, but... Come on Yui. You gotta wake up.

Ritsu:
Hey, Yui! Wake up!

Yui:
Hmm...It's okay, Ui... Today's Sunday after all...

Ritsu:
Ha! That's impressive positive thinking. Wake up, Yui! You got shows. You gotta practice. You gotta play your guitar!

Ritsu & Tsumugi & Mio & Nodoka:
... Um! ... Yui, we've got cake.

Yui:
Umm... liars... no cake...

Ritsu & Tsumugi & Mio & Nodoka:
Ah...

Ritsu:
We are losing her! Mugi, go get some cake!

Tsumugi:
Roger!

Sawako:
Miss Tainaka.

Tachibana:
Bye, Miss Yamanaka.

Sawako:
Bye, Miss Tachibana. Could you guys please return those animal costumes that I lent you a couple weeks ago The drama club wants to use them next week.

Mio:
Animal costumes Ritsu, you haven't returned those yet

Ritsu:
Oh, you mean those things Let's see... what did I do with them After we used them for our recruitment drive, I put them in the storeroom.

Mio:
Give them back!

Sawako:
... I'm stunned...

Mio:
I'm so sorry.

Ritsu:
Let's see... Where did I put those things See, here they are! ... ....

Yui:
Zzz... Light Music Club Sandwich...

OP

Mio:
So because of that, we are gonna do some spring cleaning.

Yui & Ritsu:
Ahhhh...

Mio:

And you can wipe those I don't wanna looks off your faces.

Ritsu:
Right! Let's knuckle down and practice all out today!

Yui:
Year! You got it, Ritchan! It's Budokan or bust to last!

Mio:
Wow, you're that opposed to cleaning up

Yui:
Come on...

Yui & Ritsu:
We hate cleaning more than we love three meals a day!

Mio:
That's not how that saying works!

Ritsu:
And anyway, shouldn't the people who've been assigned to the music room clean duty do all the cleaning in here, not us.

Yui:
Yeah! Yeah!

Mio:
Well, normally that would be right, but we can't make someone else clean up our mess, that's mostly our own personal belongings.

Azusa:
It's not mostly. It's all personal belongings.

Ritsu:
Indeed, it is as you say.

Yui:
Ahhh... That's my froggy...

Ritsu:
Yes, we'd better put these away...

Yui:
I've already put this away once...

Mio:
Don't put them back darn it!

Ritsu:
Okay, let's do this right.

Azusa:
This really is a lot of stuff...

Tsumugi:
Yes, we'd used it as a for-the-time-being storeroom for any odds and ends we were caring with us.

Ritsu:
That's a lot of odds and ends. What's with this pile of dolls

Yui:
Ah! I scored that big one over there for just two dollars.

Ritsu:
I didn't ask that. Here you go. Take it home.

Yui:
OK. I got them.

Ritsu:
Wait a minute. Don't forget this one.

Yui:
Huh But that one isn't mine.

Ritsu:
Ah! Then... who...

Mio:
Mm...m...

Ritsu:
It's yours, Mio!

Tsumugi:
I brought this coffee set in last year, but we never got around to using it.

Yui:
Wait a minute. You are gonna clean up the cupboard too

Tsumugi:
Might as well, we are cleaning anyway.

Ritsu:
Seeing it all laid out like that they sure look expensive, huh!

Yui:
How much is this tea set worth, Mugi-chan

Tsumugi:
Well, uh.. I don't know the exact price, but I was told that the Royal Family of Belgium has the same set.

Yui:
Royal Family...

Ritsu:
Ho, watch it!!

Ritsu:
Well, that's most of it.

Mio:

Yes, but ... um ...
There's a lot of personal items here that don't belong to us.

Tsumugi:
Perhaps they belonged to the previous members of the Light Music Club. It looks like the earlier clubs had a lot more membership.

Azusa:
They must have a proper club activities back then.

Yui:
Look, Look! ... Ta-dah!
Uu u.., Look what I found way in the back!

Ritsu:
Oh, that case looks expensive! What sort of treasure do you think lies within

Yui:
Oh! .. It's a guitar!

Azusa:
It's kinda old but it looks really nice.

Ritsu:
Damn, I was hoping for something cooler.

Yui:
Yeah, that's pretty lame.

Azusa:
We are the Light Music Club. How can an instrument be lame

Sawako:

My goodness, that really takes me back.

Azusa:
What do you mean

Sawako:
So, this is where it was.

Azusa:
Ah! Is this yours Miss Yamanaka

Sawako:
Yes, though I never really used it much.

Azusa:
Were you a part of the Light Music Club when you were in school

Sawako:
That's right. Didn't I mention that to you

Azusa:
I knew it had to be something like that. That time you played with us at the school festival, I thought you were fantastic!

Sawako:
I'm OK. I haven't played for a while, but I guess I'm better than Yui is right now.

Azusa:
Oh please, you've got to teach me!

Sawako:
Of course, I will.

Yui:
Hey, Check this out! This is what she looked like back in highschool.

Azusa:
I think I'll pass.

Sawako:
How come!

Yui:
We're all taking home our own personal stuff that we've kept here, so you can take yours.

Sawako:
Ur... mm... Ugh! It's musty! I really don't have time to play anymore.

Yui:
Ah... What do you want to do with your guitar then

Sawako:
I want you to sell it and put the proceeds in the club fund.

Yui:
Ah! .. You are so generous!

Mio:

It's more like,

Ritsu:
..We are doing hard dirty work!

Azusa:
But isn't this an awfully fancy guitar to be selling

Sawako:
I got this guitar a long time ago from a friend of my father. But if it's this dusty and moldy, it might not really be playable anymore. Besides, if it's in sellable condition, I'm sure this old guitar would be a lot happier if it was being played by someone.

Yui:
Ew... It's so musty! You're so mean for making me carry it the whole way.

Ritsu:
It's your own fault for losing three rounds of rock-paper-scissors.

Tsumugi:
Come on, you can do it Yui-chan!

Yui:
Yeah, but my bag is really heavy today.

Mio:
You've no one to blame but yourself for that.

Tsumugi:
Really good work Yui-chan. It's time for another round.

Yui:
Really Great! No way am I losing this time, .. Um!

Ritsu:
Ha! All right, then prepare to get shot down, .. Um!

Tsumugi:
.. Um!

Azusa:
You are like a bunch of children.

Ritsu:
I am a child!

Azusa:
Let's act like adults, OK

Tsumugi:
Huh, I could see it. Is that supposed to be scissors

Yui:
You are not supposed to say, Mugi-chan.

Tsumugi:
Oh!

Ritsu:
Hey, come on Mio!

Yui:
Rock-paper-scissors!

Mio:
Look at this.

Yui:
You mean that sales-ad that you picked up

Mio:
Would one of these fit in the prep-room

Ritsu:
A shelf set

Mio:
I think one of these would help us organize things.

Azusa:
You are right. At that price, I think we can manage with the funds in the club account.

Mio:
Hmm... Where's the furniture section

Tsumugi:
Wow! So, this is the home center!

Yui:
Mugi-chan...

Tsumugi:
Ah! They sell all manner of items here right Like light bulbs in all sizes and vinyl tapes in all the colors of the rainbow

Mio:
Yeah, I guess.

Ritsu:
Mugi, this is your first time in a home center

Tsumugi:
Mm-hm. I've always wanted to visit one. Um.. Let's go!

Yui:
Me too!

Ritsu:
Hey, Yui, the guitar!

Tsumugi:
Oh! My my my my ... Amazing!
Look! It says that this pen will amend the holes in the walls make them as good as new.

Azusa:
Right.

Tsumugi:
This makes it super easy to bind old magazines.

Azusa:
This stuff seems that amazing to you

Tsumugi:
Umm... This restores faucets to a sparkling new finish
Will it really

Azusa:
Ah! Mugi senpai, look at what they have up here.

Tsumugi:
A cake slicer that cut any cake into eight neat equal pieces.

Azusa:
It's like an umbrella.

Tsumugi:
Will this really work like it says

Yui:
Guys, guys! ... Come over here!
Look at this. Check out all the screws!

Azusa:
You are spazzing out, too

Yui:
These are all screws!

Azusa:
Uh-huh...

Yui:
It's so pretty! Check it out! I feel so cool! Wow!

Azusa:
What the heck is that

Yui:
A cordless screwdriver! Bang! Ba-bang!

Mio:
Quit making noise!

Yui:
Done, you two are now dead!

Azusa & Mio:

Ah..h....

Mio:
Unbelievable...

Ritsu:
Unbelievable is right. Yui, you're such a baby!

Mio:
Ugh! I'm blind! ... Take that off!

Ritsu:
Please... Miss. Stop it! I beg you... You stop it! Stop it! Stop it! ...

Mio:
I'm going to [bomb you!]

Yui:
Azu-nyan! Azu-nyan!

Azusa:
What is it this timeJun & Yui:

Yui:
This is really easy to move in.

Azusa:
It's hanging off of you.

Yui:
Maybe we can use these for a show. And we can write Afterschool Tea Time across the backs.

Azusa:
You mean like a biker gang

Mio:
Thanks. I'm sorry to disturb you. Sawa-chan says that we can keep it in the room.

Ritsu:
Ok, that's perfect. We'll have them deliver it to the club room after school tomorrow.

Mio:
Where are the others

Ritsu:
Well, they are around here somewhere.

Mio:
Ah! Here comes Mugi.

Tsumugi:
Sorry to keep you waiting.

Ritsu:
Hah! Exactly how much did you buy

Azusa:
Ah... a turtle .. Or, a terrapin

Yui:
A..A..zu-nyan. What are you looking at Ah..a...

Azusa:
Cut that out! Don't do that here.

Yui:
Ah! .. ah .. ha .. What a cute little terrapin!

Azusa:
Cute I don't even think it is a terrapin.

Yui:
Even among terrapins, this one here is a total babe!

Azusa:
No, I mean it. It says it's a pig nose turtle. It's a turtle, you see

Yui:
It's so cute, I wanna insert peanuts in its nose.

Azusa:
Exactly, how are you defining the word cute

Ritsu:
Ow..mm... I can't believe I lost four straight matches after the store.

Yui:
Hail the scissors!

Salesperson:
Well, I'm gonna need to appraise it.

Mio:
Please do.

Tsumugi:
Ah.. ah.. Ah!

Mio:
What are you looking at

Azusa:
I was wondering what our band would sound like if we had this many members in it.

Mio:
I know what you mean. It would be nice if we had that many people.

Salesperson:
I'm done with the appraisal, Miss. Thank you all for your patience. Now, about this guitar of yours. We'll be able to offer you five-thousand dollars for it.

Yui & Mio & Ritsu & Azusa:
... F-Five-thousand! ...



Yui & Mio & Ritsu & Azusa:
Ah... Hmm! ...

Salesperson:
Is there a problem

Mio:
Thank you it was delicious. Let's go!

Ritsu:
Hold it!

Mio:
A... aa... Fifty-thousand!

Ritsu:
Calm down, you added a zero there.

Tsumugi:
Thank you for all your help.

Ritsu:
You are claiming too quickly! So, why is the guitar worth so much Is it a favor to Mugi and her family

Salesperson:
Ah... No, she has nothing to do with it. This particular line of guitar which was born in the early nineteen-sixties. At the time, they hadn't completely pin down of it's materials and shape yet, and underwent a series of minor-changes until they settled on it's current design. The guitar that you brought in has a fingerboard made of Brazilian Rosewood, that wood is very rarely found in a musical instrument these days. That's one reason why it commands such a high price. Unfortunately the guitar's tail pieces have been swapped out for replacement. Since it's not a full original, that lowers its value somewhat, but the playability of this particular tail pieces is superior, and since many customers favor that type, that hardly counts against it at all. Plus this guitar appears to have been kept in its case for a long time, so there are no scratches on any fret working. For guitar of its age, it's in excellent condition, and that's why we are offering such a high price. Ah... A-Anyway it's a very rare guitar...

Ritsu:
Look at that stack!

Yui:
Why It's just a special burger!

Ritsu:
I'm not talking about the burger.

Mio:
Isn't that enough a lot of French fries

Ritsu:
Hey! We are loaded to the gills now. So, I ordered the extra large size. Keep the change!

Mio:
Whoa! You used the money

Ritsu:
Of course not, I payed for all this myself.

Azusa:
But, are you sure it's OK for us to split it up amongst ourselves

Ritsu:
Well, what else can we do Sawa-chan said that we should put it in the club fund.

Yui:
Bunny Bunny, you!

Azusa:
Yeah, but I ...

Ritsu:
Look! Five-grands split five weighs a thousand each!

Azusa:
... There is a guitar effects pedal, that I've been wanting for a while.

Ritsu:
There you see

Yui:
Ah, Azu-nyan's given in!

Mio:
Idiots! Don't wave that huge wad of cash around!

Ritsu:
You see this, a thousand of it is yous Mio...

Mio:
A thousand huh! Gee, with that much, I could ... get a fantastic state of the art multi-bass amp simulator and a brand new amplifier.

Ritsu:
I get a cool new twin bass pedal, and make a new floor tom to around at my kick.

Ui:
How's this, Yui, is this OK

Yui:
[]

Yui & Mio & Ritsu & Azusa:
... Hehehehe...

Tsumugi:
Umm... Are you guys, OK


Yui & Mio & Ritsu & Azusa & Tsumugi:
Move it here! Over here! ...

Tsumugi:
Wow, it's perfect!

Azusa:
It's all neat and tidy now, huh!

Mio:
Yeah. ... mm

Yui:
U.. uu..

Mio:
Yui!

Azusa:
We all agreed to take home our personal belongings.

Yui:
But I've got all this stuff left even after everything I took home yesterday. If I take any more, Ui's gonna get real mad at me.

Azusa:
Yeah, well, if you leave it here, I'm gonna get mad at you.

Yui:
But, Ui is so scary. Yesterday, she, ... Out!
Oh, Ui, Please forgive me! ...

Mio:
It's like she doesn't know SHE is the older sister.

Yui:
I promise that I'll clean them up later, just let me keep them here a little longer.

Ritsu:
Oh! All right. But just those, got it

Mio:
What the heck are you doingJun & Ritsu:

Ritsu:
Hah! ...

Sawako:
Hello!

Mio & Ritsu:
A.. ii.i.. !

Sawako:
So, did the shelves arrive Hey, that looks great! Uh... huh.. mm... What's the matter I said Hi but you didn't say anything.

Ritsu:
... Ha ha, .. Goodness Sawa-chan, there you are! Sorry I didn't hear you come in. Aha! ...

Sawako:
So guys, how did it go yesterday

Ritsu:
Ah, yesterday

Sawako:
Yes, with my guitar, how much did you get for it

Ritsu:
Oh, that! .. ah, m.. I forget. How much did we get for it

Azusa:
.. Oh, I think, .. it was..

Mio:
Well, it was pretty old you know, and being over fifty and all affected its value.

Sawako:
Oh, really

Yui:
Oh my! Does that mean that you're in your fifties, Sawa-chan You can tell us!

Sawako:
How many women in their fifties are as hot and look fine as this

Yui & Mio & Ritsu & {Font color|#387f9c|Jun} & {Font color|green|Azusa:}}
I didn't mean.. Sorry... We are sorry...

Sawako:

I told you that I got it from a friend of my father, remember

Yui:
Oh, lady, I forgot.

Sawako:
Now then, how much money did you get for it

Ritsu:
Well, it was around ... ah .. around a hundred dollars.

Mio:
Ritsu, what are you thinking

Azusa:
We are being a way too greedy.

Ritsu:
Sorry, It slipped out.

Sawako:
Yeah, well I figured it as much, it was moldy after all.

Sawako:
All right, why don't you give me the sale ticket

Yui & Mio & Azusa:
Ack!

Ritsu:
I beg your pardon

Sawako:
I need a receipt so I can earmark it, for the club. Don't tell me that you didn't get a receipt.

Ritsu:
No.. ah.. mm...

Sawako:
Oh, you have it right there.

Ritsu:
Um mm..... Gulp!

Sawako:
Wow!

Yui & Mio & Tsumugi & Ritsu & Azusa:
Oh! Yay there's a hero!
Chow it down! Chow it down! Chow it down! Chow it down!

Sawako:
What are you doing Spit that out, this instant!

Ritsu:
Forget it!

Sawako:
Spit out right now!

Ritsu:
(Ritsu ukes)

Sawako:
No way! It was worth five-thousand dollars That's amazing!

Tsumugi:
They said that it was extremely rare.

Ritsu:
Forgive me. I didn't mean to lie about it and hide it from you, but that vast amount of money turned my head around, and I just couldn't help myself.

Azusa:
She is easily corruptible.

Mio:
She's always been in this way.

Ritsu:
You two don't have any right to talk!

Sawako:
OK then, I'll go ahead and donate the hundred dollars that Ritsu mentioned to the Light Music Club account, consider the rest is going to pay for those shelves.

Ritsu:
Hah! ... A--ll you mean that's all

Sawako:
I would have given you the whole thing if you come clean in the first place.

Ritsu:
You are lying about that I know it.

Mio:
This whole mess is your fault, Ritsu. That's what you get for trying to hide it.

Azusa:
She is right. I told you we should have this come out and told her the truth from the very beginning.

Ritsu:
Oh! Y-ee-s! As if!!

Yui:
Please Sawa-chan, I have one must request. Please slap me with the wad of bills. Slap me in the face really hard. ... Now, I'm happy...

Ritsu:
You are in your own happy world... It must be nice.

Sawako:
Oh well, all right, I've decided to use a portion of this money to buy one thing for you guys.

Yui:
You really mean it

Sawako:
Talk it over and decide what it is you all want.

Azusa:
So, one thing huh

Ritsu:
I say that you make it five things and not just as one!

Mio:
Don't push your luck!

Ritsu:
Ow! ...

Umm... I guess an amp is the thing we need the most of all.

Azusa:
Personally, I think we could use a guitar effects pedal a lot more than an amp.

Mio:
Maybe. But neither of those things are something that all of us can use.

Yui:
.. Oh!

Everyone:
What is it

Yui:
Why don't we just buy another cute little froggy If we had two, I bet we get more members for the club.

Students:
It's so cute!

froggies:
Welcome to the Club!

Yui:
Uu... aah..a...ah.....

a student:
And you grip the handle, just don't hold it too tightly...

Yui:
Oh!

a student
Hit the ball with your whole body. If you only hit it with your hands, you will hurt your wrist and elbow, got it

students
Got it!

Ritsu:
Well, it looks like all the other clubs have their new members and places, and getting down to work.

Tsumugi:
Uh-huh.

Azusa:
Guess so...

Ritsu:
Hm...

Yui:
Azu-nyan's lonely

Ritsu:
Uh-huh. I know she said that she was OK with the five of us, but I know she wants a kohai.

Tsumugi:
The very same thing had occurred to me.

Mio:
You know, I was thinking that too.

Yui:
Yeah remember, how happy we were when Azu-nyan joined our club

Ritsu:
That settled then. Here goes! One of you new students, help me to the music room, please!

Mio:
You tried that already.

Ritsu:
What will we do, then

Yui:
O...Oh, I have a great idea!

Azusa:
Umm... What's this doing here

Yui:
Meet Ton-chan, he is our brand new member!

Tsumugi:
Yes, we had Sawa-chan to buy him for you. This is your new kohai, so be good to each other.

Azusa:
Ah ...

Ritsu:
You know, I was expecting a bigger reaction, weren't you

Mio:
Uh-huh.

Yui:
Ha

Ritsu:
You were the one who said that Azusa would like this turtle, Yui.

Yui:
But Azu-nyan was staring at him like she wanted him really badly.

Azusa:
You were the one who staring at it, not me. I was just looking because I thought it had a really strange face.

Yui:
Ahh!

Ritsu:
Man, we really blew it.

Yui:
A.. a...

Tsumugi:
Yui.

Azusa:
What made you decide to do this

Ritsu:
Well ...

Mio:
We all thought that you might be lonely because you didn't have a kohai.

Tsumugi:
That' why.

Yui:
So we bought a new member for you.

Azusa:
It must stink to become someone's pet because they jumped to their own conclusion.

Everyone:
Ah.. Wow! ...

Tsumugi:
It nodded!

Yui:
That was so cute!

Azusa:
Don't you worry. I'm gonna take real good care of you from now on, OK

Yui:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm gonna take care of you, too!

Azusa:
It is too much responsibility for you, Yui.

Yui:
Umm.. Oh, come on, it is not!

Yui:
Ah!... He is so cu--ute!

Ritsu:
Listen to me! Ever since Sawa-chan became our homeroom teacher, hasn't it seem like her skin's been glowing and her hair's been soft and shiny It's like she's blossoming or something. I want to shine like her too!

Tsumugi:
Aha! He looked at you, Yui-chan.

Ui:
That's bad manners, you know

Yui:
It's OK. I'm thinking about how we can make Ritsu-chan shine, even when she's sitting in the dark.

Ui:
Hah
Yui:
Ah! He's so cute! Hehehe!

Tsumugi:
Mio, are you scared of it?

Mio:
Uh! I'm not scared. I just haven't reached the point where I think it's cute yet.

Yui:
Huh? But he IS cute. Right, Ton-chan? Hehe.

Tsumugi:
He looked at you!

Yui:
Ah, he's looking at me! I'm right over here! Ton-chan…

Tsumugi:
Hey, Ton-chan!

Yui:
You try calling him too, Mio-chan!

Mio:
Uh! Ton- …chan …'Kay, that was cute.

Yui:
Right, right?

Azusa:
Yui-senpai, if we're going to keep him, we have to look after him properly, too. The water must be kept at a precise temperature and changed regularly.

Yui:
Wow, he's higher maintenance than Gita!

Azusa:
He also has to be fed everyday.

Tsumugi:
Ah, if you ever run low on food, I'll bring some from home. We have Chinese pond turtles, Asian yellow pond turtles, and Eastern musk turtles, too!

Mio:
(She's an expert!)

Azusa:
That'd be a big help!

Yui:
Don't you worry; we're all gonna take real good care of you!

Mio:
That's right. We won't get sick of you and just throw you away.

Ritsu:
I'm sick of this! [whimpers] I'm sick of the drums! [crying]

Yui:
Rit-chan, what's the matter?


Mio:
What do you mean you're sick of the drums?

Ritsu:
Sorry! That was an exaggeration. However! Look at this. This is our club activity footage, recorded by the Student Council. I got it from Nodoka.

Tsumugi:
Ha, that's our freshman year!

Yui:
That takes me back!

Azusa:
I saw that one. We all saw Mio-senpai's --

Mio:
Ah, stop the video!

Ritsu:
No way! Look at where the drums are.

Yui:
You're all dark, Rit-chan.

Mio:
[wails in fear]

Yui:
Your forehead is nice and bright!

Ritsu:
Hey, shut up!

Mio:
I guess the lights just aren't hitting you.

Azusa:
Yeah, because you're way in back.

Tsumugi:
When looking from straight on, you're the only one of us who isn't visible.

Ritsu:
And it's not just this show. Last year's welcome show…

Tsumugi:
Ah, you're dark!

Ritsu:
And this year's welcome show…

Yui:
Oh!

Azusa:
I think I saw your foot.

Mio:
Wow, the camera misses you completely.

Azusa:
So… what do we do?

Ritsu:
…I wanna play another instrument.

Mio:
Huh? Wait just a minute, you can't just change instruments. Who's gonna play the drums if you don't?

Ritsu:
[squeaky whimpering]

Mio:
She hasn't thought this through! Besides, weren't you the one who said you hated how fiddly the other instruments were?

Ritsu:
That's true, but maybe we should try switching instruments every once and a while. Just for laughs.

Other four girls:
Huh?

Yui:
It sound like a lot of fun!

Tsumugi:
That's a great idea!

Mio:
Uh!

Yui:
Wanna try playing the guitar?

Ritsu:
Oh, is that ok?

Mio:
Ah!

Ritsu:
Tada!

Tsumugi:
Ah, that suits you rather well!

Azusa:
Yeah, looking real good, senpai!

Mio:
It seems out of character…

Tsumugi:
Why don't you try playing something?

Yui:
[wails]

Azusa:
What's the matter, Yui-senpai?

Yui:
Gita's cheating on me!

Azusa: You willingly handed him over with a smile on your face.

Yui:
Thank you, Gita. We had good times, you and I.

Azusa:
If it's not one thing, it's another.

Ritsu:
So, teacher, what do I do first?

Yui:
Me?! Teacher?! Ah! Sure, Rit-chan, I'll teach you!

Mio:
I'll just go make us all some tea. She'll get bored of this soon enough.

Yui:
You form the chords with your left hand, and you strum with your right one.

Ritsu:
Sorry, but I already know all that stuff?

Yui:
Uhh? What should I teach you then?

Azusa:
Fine, guess I'll be handling this! For now, let's try playing Fuwa Fuwa Time.

Ritsu:
Yes, ma'am! Let's see..

Azusa:
Uh, it might be easier if you played sitting down.

Ritsu:
Then I'll sit down. Ready.

Azusa:
Ok, the first chord in the song is an E. Your index finger goes on string 3 at fret 1, and uh, the middle on on string 5 at fret 2, and then your ring finger goes on string 4 at fret 2. Umm… your index finger goes here, and the middle one here, just like this, you see! Now, pressing down your fingers like that, strum the guitar.

Ritsu:
Hm!

Yui:
Um, Rit-chan? Try to keep your right hand really relaxed, uh, like a cooked noodle!

Azusa:
And keep the fingers pressing on the strings curled more. Some of the notes aren't coming out cleanly.

Yui:
Rit-chan, you need to hold the pick gently. Very gently.

Azusa:
Ok, the sound is starting to come together. Ritsu-senpai, keep your back a little straighter.

Yui:
You should move your left wrist foreword a little bit!

Azusa:
So, shall we move on to the next chord?

Yui:
It's pretty tough to play, isn't it?

Ritsu:
I'm not cut out for this.

Azusa and Mio:
Huh?

Ritsu:
Wow, it's a big pain to have to keep track of all that stuff. I had no idea…

Yui:
That's quite all right! Welcome back, Gita! Hehe, who's a good boy?

School girls:
Good morning, Miss Yamanaka!

Sawako:
Good morning! Good morning, Rit-chan!

Ritsu:
Oh, hey, Sawa-chaaa…ahh. (Ah, Sawa-chan is glowing!)

Yui & Tsumugi & Mio & Jun: & {Font color|#526e26|Nodoka:}}
Let's dig in!

Tsumugi:
Nodoka, your lunches always look so wonderfully delicious.

Yui:
Yeah, Nodoka-chan has always been a terrific cook!

Mio:
So's Ui-chan!

Yui:
Am I the luckiest girl in the world or what?

Nodoka:
I've noticed your lunches are always packed full, Mugi.

Tsumugi:
Mhm, I burn up a lot of energy!

Nodoka:
(On what?)

Tsumugi:
Mio, your lunches always look so cute and cuddly!

Yui:
Well, I guess your mother must still thing of you as her darling little girl, huh? Hehe.

Tsumugi:
…What's Ritsu doing?

Yui:
Just wandering around.

Nodoka:
Like a bird.

Mio:
Kinda like Cozy Powell, in a good way. (She's been restless for as long as I've known her; she gets bored so easily. But her drumming has been the one constant.)

Ritsu:
I'm back!

Yui:
Ha! Welcome home! Rit-chan, here! Have some of Nodoka-chan's omelet.

Ritsu:
Oh! Can I? …You already took a bite…

Ritsu:
And on that note, I'll be trying out the keyboard today!

Mio:
Exactly what note are you talking about?

Yui:
Another "Shine on, you crazy Rit-chan" installment?

Ritsu:
You don't, understand, Yui, I have to shine!

Yui:
Huh?

Ritsu:
When everyone has their eyes on you, that's when you sparkle! Like her!

Sawako:
Ahh… uh? What was that?

Ritsu:
Just look at her! Ever since Sawa-chan became our homeroom teacher, it seems like her skin's been glowing, and her hair's been silky and shiny. It's like she's blossoming or something!

Sawako:
Mhm! I guess I get more chances to take the stage -- a teacher's lectern, in this case -- now that I'm a homeroom teacher.

Ritsu:
And I wanna sparkle, too!

Mio:
So you're gonna try out the keyboard.

Ritsu:
Mhmhm.

Yui:
It said "Bingo"!

Azusa:
Can you read sheet music, Ritsu-senpai?

Yui:
It said, I read it fine!

Mio:
(How can she interpret that?) You're making trouble for Mugi, so-- …or not.

Tsumugi:
Ahhh! My keyboard it actually speaking! Ah! Oh, it just said "Mugi-chan"!

Yui:
It did, it did!

Mio:
Oh, brother.

Ritsu:
It's neat how you can get so many different tones out of the keyboard.

Tsumugi:
Hah, I'm getting all sorts of wonderful ideas for new songs!

Azusa:
(What kind of songs?)

Yui:
This is so cool!

Mio:
That looks like fun! Mugi, you think I might be able to have a try?

Ritsu:
[evil chuckle]

Mio:
Huh?! Stop that! I hate that! Ritsu, stop making that sound!

Ritsu:
Fine, I'm sorry! Ok?! What am I doing? Jerk!

Yui:
Hey, Rit-chan, aren't you gonna try playing the bass?

Mio:
No, not the bass!

Yui:
Why not?

Mio:
I'm on bass… and I don't ever wanna play anything but the bass. I only wanna be a bassist. Mm. I just love its low, deep sound. The way it supports all of you without ever standing out. I also like writing bass lines that fit in with everything you're doing. One who doesn't take center stage, but doesn't get drowned out by the other members: that's the kind of bassist I always wanna be.

Ritsu:
I knowJun & Mio: That's why I'll never touch your bass, Mio. So don't worry about it!

Yui:
Oh! I do declare, I'm kinda jealous, Miss Tainaka.

Ritsu:
Don't be like that.

Mio:
Mmmm…

Other four girls:
Oh!

Mio:
I said way too much!

Yui:
Oh! Hey, Mio-chan! Mio-chan, hello?

Ritsu:
Oh, she's turning into one of the living dead!

Tsumugi:
That is so great! It's just like Mio and her bass are one and the same.

Azusa:
I know what you mean; I love her bass playing.

Tsumugi:
Mhm, so do I.

Yui:
Oh, come on, how long is she gonna stay stiff as a board? Ah, don't worry, Rit-chan. Just leave everything to me! I'm gonna work this all out, you'll see. Snap out of it, Mio! [unintelligible]

Ritsu:
What am I leaving to her?

Ui:
Hm? Sis, what are you doing? That's bad manners, you know.

Yui:
I'm sitting here in a dark corner trying to formulate operation "Shine on, you crazy Rit-chan"!

Ui:
Huh? Well, I'd like to wash the dishes, but… I guess it can wait.

Yui:
…Oh…

Sawako:
[humming]

Photographer:
Ok, here we go!

Sawako:
There's another class after us, so get into position quickly.

Keiko:
All right, how do you want us to line up?

Sawako:
Um, by seat number?

Nobuyo:
Wouldn't it be better if we lined up by height?

Sawako:
Oh, you're right. Thank you for that. This is the very first homeroom class I've ever had, so please, if I make any mistakes, be sure to point them out.

Keiko:
Miss Yamanaka is really great!

Nobuyo:
It's like she's getting prettier and prettier every day!

Sawako:
[giggles]

Mio:
(I like being on the end.)

Tsumugi:
I think I'll stand here. [laughs]

Ristu:
'Scuse me! Could you squeeze over just a little bit?

Mio:
We're lining up by height, remember?

Ritsu:
Watch this!

Tsumugi:
Ah, Rit-chan, you've grown taller!

Mio:
You're sneaky.

Yui:
Look, we're all together!

Mio:
I guess we're not going by height anymore.

Ritsu:
I say we're better off being all together.

Yui:
Me too! It's gonna be a great class picture!

Sawako:
So is everyone in position? All right, whenever you're ready.

Photographer:
Ok, everybody smile! Say cheese!

Yui:
Hey, this is great!

Ritsu:
What are you doing?

Yui:
Heh, Rit-chan, we moved the drum set around, see. You're smack in the middle now!

Ritsu:
Uhh…

Yui:
I was thinking about this idea all night long. You were right about changing things! C'mon, try it out, try it out!

Ritsu:
All right, Yui!

Yui:
Ok, we'll use this position from now on!

Ritsu:
Hmm… I'm embarrassed.

Sawako:
Mmmm… I think this works best.

All five girls:
Yeah, so do I.

Yui:
But don't worry, Rit-chan, you'll still shine!

Ritsu:
Ahh!

Yui:
I'm gonna use this headlamp to light you up!

Ritsu:
Cut it out!

Yui:
Shine on, you crazy Rit-chan!

Ritsu:
Oww-ahh-ohh…

Mio:
Stop it! Yui, look at her! She's gasping for breath!

Yui:
Oopsie…

Yui:
Hey, Rit-chan, you aren't lonely, are you?

Ritsu:
Ehh, why do you ask?

Yui:
Well you're always in the back, so I thought you might get lonely.

Ritsu:
No, not really…

Yui:
What if we try something new. When we're playing, we'll just interact with you more. Kinda like this! [mouth guitar]

Ritsu:
[gasping]

Yui:
Right, now you guys try it. Let's practice how we're gonna interact with Rit-chan who's feeling lonely there in the back.

Azusa:
[sighs]

Yui:
Let's do it! One, two-- [mouth guitar] Hey! [mouth guitar] Hey!

Ritsu:
[gasps]

Yui:
Doesn't that work perfectly?

Mio:
[sighs]

Ritsu:
Yui, you don't understand. That's really not why I'm doing this.

Yui:
Don't go it alone. Rit-chan, if you're hurting, we're all hurting. I won't let you suffer alone!

Ritsu:
Yui! Look, I'm not suffering!

Yui:
Let's get through this together!

Ritsu:
Ahh! Why won't you listen to me!

Yui:
Uh, and I brought all this other stuff, too…

Azusa:
Just give it up, Yui, and take it all back home.

Yui:
Hey, Azu-nyan?

Azusa:
Yes?

Yui:
If Rit-chan doesn't play the drums, I was thinking I might take over.

Azusa:
Huh? Why do you say that?

Yui:
Well, something's really bothering Rit-chan, I know it. It's like she's in a… what's the word I'm looking for? Sounds like gut, not mutt…

Azusa:
Wait, do you mean rut?

Yui:
Yeah, that!

Azusa:
Then you were pretty far off.

Yui:
I think that's why she suddenly wants to try out a bunch of different things.

Azusa:
You really think so?

Yui:
That's why I'm gonna start playing the drums! I'll just sit behind you guys and play the drums.

Azusa:
Maybe not. I think I'd rather you stay where I can see you.

Yui:
Uh, why?

Azusa:
You're reading too much into it, senpai.

Sawako:
[humming] This'll make my skin glow even more!

Ritsu:
[sighs] Huh?! Hmm… thinking about it, I just realized I haven't played my drums for a few days. I was the one who suggested it, but… (I've played the drums every day, ever since I decided I was going to be a drummer.) Mmm. {Let's start a band, Mio! And I'll be the drummer!)

Mio:
(Sounds like fun, but why the drums?)

Ritsu:
(Isn't it awesome how they flail around back there?)

Mio:
Oh!

Ritsu:
(Well, I could only afford drumsticks at first. [gasping in surprise] And later on, I finally got my hands on a used drumkit. And every day since… [sighs] …I still have some callouses. I really wailed away on them at first. [sighs] … [happy sighing])

Satoshi:
Sis, keep it down!

Ritsu and Mio:
[gasping for breath]

Mio:
How could you have overslept?

Ritsu:
I was up late watching a movie!

Mio:
Huh?!

Ritsu:
In a village far from civilization, they have this horrific custom where--

Mio:
[gasps and whimpers]

Ritsu:
I'm kidding! It was a who concert!

Mio:
Huh? What?

Ritsu:
The. Who.

Mio:
Oh, right, you like that band's drummer, don't you, Ritsu?

Ritsu:
Hmm? …Crap! Mio, get a move on!

Sawako:
Please make sure you fill out the self-study activity form for the class trip by tomorrow, ok? There are so many temples that it will seem daunting, but but plan ahead to give yourselves enough time to visit each in turn.

Yui:
Ah! Rit-chan! Mio-chan! I thought you were home sick!

Ristu:
Shh!

Class:
[laughs]

Ritsu:
Heh heh, sorry about that, heh heh-- whoa!

Sawako:
All right, take your seats, please!

Ritsu:
Sawa-chan?

Sawako:
Mm? Mm?

Yui:
What's wrong, Sawa-chan?

Ritsu:
Huh, it's freaky.

Sawako:
I've been trying all sorts of creams to make my skin glow even more.

Ritsu and Yui:
[gasp]

Yui:
Oh my goodness.

Ritsu and Yui:
You overdid it.

Ritsu:
Tada! It's drums or nothing for me!

Mio:
[laughs] Yeah, I figured as much! She told me she watched a Keith Moon DVD yesterday.

Yui:
Who's that?

Mio:
He's a drummer Ritsu really admires.

Azusa:
Oh! He's the guy they called "Moon the Loon" and "Mad Moon", right? I heard he demolished his house with cherry bombs or something.

Ritsu:
Well, that's not what I admire about him. You know, even if I'm in the shadows, and aren't in the spotlight, and you can only see my feet, I still love playing my drums!

Yui:
Yeah! No one but you can be our drummer. When we all look back at you when we're just about to start a song, you count us in with your sticks, and you have a big grin on your face. That always gets me so pumped up! Besides, I also learned some things thanks to you. Even though we're all in the same band, what we see and think are sometimes very different. We all have our own places here, and each of us IS different. But when--

Ritsu:
But when we start playing, we become one!

Yui:
Right!

Ritsu:
You know, as I sit on my stool and watch your backs, I listen to you play, and I bang away on my drums, I love it!

Four other girls:
[chuckle]

Tsumugi:
Oh, I also did something thanks to you! I wrote us a brand new song.

Four other girls:
Huh?

Tsumigi:
And it was all because you made my keyboard speak to me that day.

Mio:
You mean, those noises?

Azusa:
What kind of song is it?

Yui:
I wanna hear it!

Tsumugi:
[humming Honey Sweet Tea Time]

Ritsu:
Yeah, I like it!

Yui:
Hey, I think you should play and sing this one, Mugi-chan!

Tsumugi:
[gasps]

Azusa:
Great idea!

Mio:
Yeah, that might work!

Ritsu:
Mio, get to work on the lyrics.

Tsumugi:
Um, you guys? I also thought of a real good title for the song.

Yui:
What is it, what is it?

Tsumugi:
I call it "honey Sweet Tea Time"!

Ritsu:
Tea again, huh?

Yui:
Wow, these rusks are fantastic when you put honey all over them!

Ritsu:
It's the intermingling of flavors, the combination of tastes!

Azusa:
Um, you've got some stick stuff on the side of your mouth.

Yui:
Hm? Wipe it for me, will ya?

Azusa:
No way. (Here, wipe it yourself!)

Ritsu:
(They're a good team, in their own way.)

Azusa:
Ah, what am I gonna do with you? (You've got it all over!)

Mio:
The honey-colored afternoon passes by, and it's honey sweet tea time.

Tsumugi:
Hey, how would it sound if we repeated that phrase twice?

Mio:
Hmm, that could work.

Ritsu & Yui & Jun & Azusa:
[chewing]

Mio:
I can't concentrate!

Tsumugi:
Well, then maybe we should all just take a break!

Mio:
Mhm!

Kyoto, Kyoto!

Rit-chan, what's that? It looks like a giant daikon radish! There's one over here, too!

Ritsu:
Haha, that's so goofy!

Yui:
Kitano Tenman-gū…

Ritsu:
Hey, is this place famous or something? Ahh, what view!

Yui:
Wow! All of that is Kyoto?

Ritsu:
Oops.

Mio:
How could this have happened?

Ritsu:
We're lost.

Yui:
Please, just for a while?

Tsumugi:
I have tasty snacks, too!
Part A
Ui:
And that's that! [sighs] That takes care of the clothes. Hanky and tissues, check. Guidebook, check. Various snacks, check. Right, preparations complete. Ok, the class trip starts today. Sis', that is. Wake up, it's morning!

Yui:
[groans]

OP

Ritsu:
Yay, a trip, a trip! Oh yeah, I'm getting even more amped up.

Mio:
Hey, you really should keep your feet off the seat.

Yui:
She's right; it's not very ladylike, you know.

Mio:
And you shouldn't eat snacks nonstop either, Yui. (Put it away. Hey, wait!)

Yui:
Here, guys. I'm sharing, I've got some Matsutake Mountain!

Girl:
Thanks!

Mio:
[sighs] No one listens.

Tsumugi:
Here, have a cup of tea.

Mio:
Ah, thank you Mugi!

Ritsu:
That's out Mugi! Oh, right, let's all take a picture together!

Yui:
I agree!

Mio:
Could you please settle down a little?

Ritsu:
It'll be something to remember out trip.

Yui:
I wanna look real cute.

Sawako:
You there, sit down! Don't leave your seats unless it's very important!

Ritsu:
We told Mio that, but she wanted a picture!

Mio:
Wah?!

Sawako:
What are you talking about? Get back to your seats this instant!

Ritsu:
We want you in it, too!

Yui:
C'mon and join us!

Sawako:
No, I'm not joining you; you girls are just unbelievable! [gasps] Don't let it get to you, we're just getting started.

Yui:
Huh? But you should wrap the seaweed around the rice first. Seaweed tastes a lot better when it's soft.

Ritsu:
That's why you're still such a little girl, Yui. With seaweed, you wrap it around the fillings right before you eat it. And that lets you savor the aroma and the crispy texture..! [squeals and gasps] Yui, it's Mt. Fuji!

Yui:
Ah, where? I dropped my snacks…

Mio:
Huh? Are you two gradeschoolers?

Yui & Mio:
Ow!

Ritsu:
Oohh! Pretty!

(Afraid not; it's four girls to a group, and the Light Music club should all be together. It's gonna be a lot of work, but try to keep Yui out of trouble.)

Ritsu:
Mio, Mio, take a picture! And get Mt. Fuji in the background!

Mio:
[sighs] It's not just Yui -- I have to keep Ritsu in line, too!

Nodokai:
(I feel like someone's staring at me…)

Announcer:
Kyoto, Kyoto! Make sure you have all your belongings (as you reach the xxx)

Ritsu:
We're finally here!

Yui:
We're finally to Kyoto, Rit-chan! [mumbling in background] (I wanna see a geisha!)

Mio:
I forget -- where do we go first?

Tsumugi:
It says that from Kyoto station, we're supposed to board a bus to…

Ritsu:
Let us sally forth!

Mio:
Sally forth?

Ritsu:
Yeah, right?! We're in the ancient capital of Kyoto, so let's play a game where we talk all old-timey.

Yui:
Game, huh?

Ritsu:
Verily!

Mio:
[sighs]

Sawako:
All right, I want all the team leaders to make sure that your team is accounted for. (We're going to be traveling by bus, so if anyone is prone to be carsick, take your medicine now. We'll be moving in class order from high to low, so Class 2, follow Class 3.)

Ritsu:
Why is she making us all sit down here? I mean, take our rest upon ye floor?

Mio:
It's just so she can take roll. There's almost always one or two students missing at this point in the trip.

Sawako:
We don't want to cause any trouble for the people around us, so walk in a single file, ok?

Yui:
[snoring]

Ritsu:
Is she… asleep?

Mio:
'Cause she overate.

Ritsu:
Sometimes she's such a ditz!

Yui:
Rit-chan, what's that? It looks like a giant daikon radish! There's one over here, too!

Ritsu:
Haha, that's so goofy!

All four girls:
[giggle]

Sawako:
Hey, hurry up and get on the bus!

Yui:
Gotta take a load off.

Mio:
Hm?

Yui:
[sighs] I'm tired.

Mio:
You're just sleepy from eating so much.

Yui:
I think I'll eat these next!

Ritsu:
[laughs]

Mio:
Give it a rest, will ya?

Yui:
Rit-chan, hurry up! [panting] This way! I see it, I see it! [giggles and gasps] Oh, pretty!

Mio:
That's amazing.

Tsumugi:
It's so shiny!

Yui:
I've never seen anything like it. Is it really made of gold? I mean, made-y of gold-y?

Ritsu:
It sure is! I mean, verily and forsooth! But thinketh not of stealing, uh, absconding with some, eh, trifling amount of yon gold! A cop, er, officer of ye law-y will arrest, uh, thee forthwith, that is? Um… verily…

Mio:
(She's finally tired of it.)

Tsumugi:
The original Kinkaku-ji was laid waste by fire in the year nineteen hundred and fifty, and what stands before thine eyes is newly constructed. The pavilion once resides the reliquary, the enshrined bones of the Buddha contained is known by all as "Kinkaku-ji, the Golden Pavilion Temple". However, "Deer Garden Temple" is its true moniker.

Yui & Mio:
[clapping] Oh!

Yui:
Oh look, they have matcha tea here! Now, that's the really bitter kind of tea, isn't it?

Ritsu:
Yeah, but it comes with sweets. You wanna try a cup?

Mio:
How is that any different than what we do after school everyday?

Ritsu:
So what if it isn't?

Tsumugi:
C'mon, let's try it!

Ritsu:
Ah! Well, down the hatch, I suppose.

Tsumugi:
From what I've been told, when you drink matcha in a tea ceremony or whatnot, you always eat the sweet first and then you drink the tea. Apparently doing that enhances the bitterness of the matcha.

Ritsu:
[groans]

Mio:
Hey, don't give me that. You know, studying a little refined etiquette like that would probably do you a lot of good.

Yui:
She's right. You eat like a glutton, Rit-chan. You're quite uncouth and unrefined.

Ritsu:
You're one to talk!

Yui:
Kitano Tenman-gū…

Ritsu:
Hey, is this place famous or something?

Yui:
I dunno, beats me.

Ritsu:
It's not like we don't have lot of shinto shrines around our school.

Yui:
Ooh, I bet there's a big Buddha statue here!

Ritsu:
That's a temple.

Nodokai:
This shrine's god is well known as a patron of knowledge and learning. He's famous among students who are taking college exams.

Yui & Ritsu:
Oh…

Nodokai:
Now, there are cow statues scattered all around the shine. They say that if you pet a cow's head like this, it can actually make you a bit smarter.

Yui & Ritsu:
[gasp] That's a good little cow! [unintelligible babbling]

Nodokai:
Um… (I wonder if they'll be struck down for this…)

Sawako:
Stop that! I can't believe you, are you nuts?

Nodokai:
(Thought so.)

Yui:
Rit-chan! Ema horse prayers!

Ritsu:
Oh! Ema, huh? Ok, Yui, this'll make for some good memories. Let's go write something!

Yui:
Hm! Yeah, let's go send out wishes to the god of this place!

Ritsu:
Right! Ema, ema!

Yui & Ritsu:
Moo, moo!

Mio:
They'll get denied.

Sawako:
Excuse me, I'd… uh, heh, like one of these marriage charms, please.

Shopkeeper:
That'll be six dollars, please. Here you are.

Yui:
Hey, god, mighty Kenji!

Tsumugi:
Please hear us!

Yui:
Please grant our wishes.

Ritsu:
Please grant the tender wishes of us minions. Ha! Think they'll come true?

Yui:
I hope so, Rit-chan!

Tsumugi:
Please grant them!

Ritsu:
Oops, we forgot to make a donation!

Yui:
What? You mean we have to do it again?

Sawako:
What is the matter with you girls, are you doing this on purpose?! [crying]

Ritsu:
Sawa-chan, you've got it all wrong.

Tsumugi:
We were simply writing down our wishes on prayer plaques.

Yui:
Yeah, Sawa-chan -- to remind ourselves what our dreams are.

Sawako:
Don't give me any of your lame excuses; get over here!

Yui:
Ahh, I'm exhausted.

Mio:
Me too, I was in a cold sweat back there.

Ritsu:
Yui, make sure you get changed first.

Yui:
Aw, I don't wanna…

Ritsu:
Hey, don't give me any of your lip, young lady.

Yui:
Oh, you wanna fight, huh?

Yui & Ritsu:
Huh?

Mio:
You know what? We still have a bit of time, so why don't we make ourselves some tea?

Yui:
We should have brought some games or something that we could play with.

Ritsu:
Hey, I have some cards.

Tsumugi:
Really? In that case, why don't we play this? It's called "The Life Guessing Game".

Ritsu:
Yeah! That's the one where you do whatever you have to to become a celebrity.

Yui:
I think we should have some snacks while we're playing.

Ritsu:
Agreed!

Mio:
But we'll be eating dinner in a little while.

Yui:
Don't worry about it!

Ritsu:
We'll have room for dinner, too.

Mio:
Well, you better clean your plates.

Haruko:
You mean you guys are full already? Wow, what a waste.

Ritsu:
We're just taking a little… break.

Yui:
Yeah, we'll finish everything.

Tsumugi:
You know, I've always thought that you have such lovely hair!

Mio:
Uh, I… do? Well, thank you. But it is a pain when it gets dry in the winter. Yours is really nice, too. Do you have a perm, Mugi?

Tsumugi:
Not at all; it's naturally frizzy. (I'm so jealous of you and your straight hair.)

Ritsu:
Ahh, maybe I should grow my hair out, too. I wonder if it would make me look more feminine…

Yui:
[chuckles]

Ritsu:
Hey, what's up with you? [gasps] You're laughing! Euh, what are you picturing?

Yui:
Bang monster! [laughing]

Ritsu:
Yui, that's not nice!

Yui:
Do you wanna grow taller, too?

Ritsu:
Bleh! [coughs] I'll be tall one day, and then you're gonna be really sorry!

Mio:
Ok, I'm turning off the light.

Yui:
Ready! I've got the alarm clock set.

Mio:
We have an early day tomorrow.

Tsumugi:
Heh!

Yui:
Huah!

Mio:
Huh?

Ritsu:
Teacher, Miss Kotobuki did it!

Tsumugi:
Ahhhh…

Mio:
Ah! Mugi, what are you--

Yui:
Haha! You wanna have a pillow fight? You're on! Ah!

Ritsu:
Haha! How about a little less talking and a lot more fighting, little lady!

Yui:
Oh yeah? Well, feel the wrath of my mighty pitch!

Ritsu:
Oh! [laughing] Gotta try harder tha--

Tsumugi:
[laughing]

Ritsu:
Uh. What a heavy pitch. You will pay!

All four girls:
[fake snoring]

Sawako:
Hm.

Ritsu:
Oww!

Sawako:
Now go to sleep! Ugh!

Ritsu:
Whoa, that was a close call!

Mio:
What?

Ritsu:
Mugi! Our glorious battle is not yet finished!

Tsumugi:
Well, bring it on!

Mio:
[sighs]

Ritsu:
Take that!

All four girls:
[screaming and laughing]

Mio:
Ok, lights out.

Yui:
Sure. Goodnight, guys.

Tsumugi:
Goodnight!

Ritsu:
Honor has been satisfied. [snoring]

Yui:
Could you turn off the nightlight?

Mio:
[sighs]

Tsumugi:
Skull. [laughing] … Lycopene. [laughing]

Ritsu:
Lyco…bing! [laughing]

Tsumugi:
[laughing] [snorts]

Yui:
Huh?

Ritsu:
Mugi snorted!

Ritsu, Tsumugi, Yui:
[laughing]

Mio:
Mmmm….

Yui:
[laughs]

Part B
Sawako:
All right, now. Is everyone assembled? Today's your independent day. It's very important that each team sticks to their planned routes, and if anything at all happens, just call me on my cell phone. (Also, please make sure you're all back here by six o'clock.)

Yui:
Anyway, that store was having a monster sale on tasty snacks!

Ritsu:
So that's why you had so many of them crammed into your bag.

Yui:
Yeah! That's right!

Sawako:
Grr… Get back here, you two!

Yui & Ritsu:
Uh!

Mio:
Let's see, now… Our team is supposed to go up to Mt. Arashi this morning.

Tsumugi:
Oh… Hey, why don't we all take a taxi there, then?

Mio:
Good idea! That'll save us a lot of time, and it should be-- Huh? Where's Yui and Ritsu? Uh!

Ritsu:
Right! This is our first stop!

Mio:
We've come all the way to Kyoto and you're looking at a music store?! Get a move on, we're going!

Ritsu:
Wah, you're so mean! [wails]

Mio:
You'll have time to look after we come back!

Ritsu:
We just wanted a minute!

Mio:
Come now, or we'll just leave you behind!

Ritsu:
Hey, they have lefty models on display here. [gasps]


Ritsu:
Oh! So this is Mt. Arashi!

Yui:
Wow, look at all the cute shops!

Ritsu:
And there's lots of people, too.

Mio:
Ok, we'll start with the Togetsu Bridge and--

Ritsu:
Awesome, look; it says right here there's a monkey park!

Yui:
Oh, really? Monkeys?! They have monkeys here?!

Mio:
We've come all the way to Kyoto, and you wanna go look at a bunch of monkeys? Yui! Ritsu!

Ritsu:
Yahoo, we're here! The top of the mountain! Oh, what a view!

Yui:
Wow! All of that is Kyoto?

Mio:
I wasn't expecting such a terrific view!

Tsumugi:
Hey, Mio, it looks like they have it set up so you feed the monkeys over in that rest area. Mhm. [gasps]

Yui:
There's nothing to be afraid of, Mugi-chan. Look -- see?

Tsumugi:
Oh… ah! I did it!

Yui:
[laughs] See?

Tsumugi:
Yes, it wasn't frightening at all.

Yui:
Boy, that was fun. We sure got our monkey's worth, huh?

Ritsu:
[laughs] That was fun.

Yui:
Ah, look, they have souvenirs!

Ritsu:
Wow, you're right; those are so cute!

Yui:
That reminds me -- we have to buy something for Azu-nyan.

Mio:
That's right. She had to stay behind at school.

Tsumugi:
In that case, shouldn't we get her something that shouts, "Kyoto"?

Yui:
Something that shouts, "Kyoto"? Hmm… This maybe?

Tsumugi:
How about this?

Ritsu:
No way, get this!

Mio:
No, this.

Yui:
Gosh, we saw so much!

Mio:
I wish we'd seen more famous spots, though.

Ritsu:
Man, I'm so glad that I had a whole bunch of money in my wallet today. Check it out -- look at all this stuff I bought!

Yui:
Yeah me too! Hm, why did I have so much money, anyway?

Mio:
To buy souvenirs for your families.

Yui: & Ritsu:
[gasp] Uhh…

Mio:
You really forgot about that?

Mio:
Well, it's about time. We should head back to the hotel.

Tsumugi:
Why don't we take the train back?

Mio:
Good idea.

Ritsu:
All right, then, the station is this way. Follow me! …Oops.

Mio:
Ritsu, are we lost?

Ritsu:
We're not lost.

Mio:
You were looking that the map the whole time!

Ritsu:
I'm double checking it right now.

Yui:
Haha, cut it out, cut it out! Stop it, that really tickles, haha. Ok, sit there, shake hands, (that's it?)

Mio:
Incredible.

Ritsu:
Um, forsooth? Perhaps ye could help us?

Lady:
What?

Ritsu:
Eh, how doth to we get-eth to yon train station from hence, m'lady?

Lady:
Oh, the station. Uh, go straight that way for a few blocks, and then turn right when the street dead ends.

Ritsu:
Ah, verily? Many thanks! Ah, she understood!

Yui:
Congrats, Rit-chan!

Mio:
Were you able to get directions?

Ritsu:
Oh yeah, you bet. This way, guys! Follow me! …We're lost.

Mio:
How could this have happened?

Tsumugi:
It would simplify things if we knew where we were.

Mio:
Yeah…

Yui:
Oh, right! Ah, Azu-nyan? Listen, we managed to get ourselves hopelessly lost.

Mio:
How is calling Azusa supposed to help us?

Yui:
Oh, you're right.

Nodokai:
Look, Yui's over there! Yui, Mio!

Yui:
Ah, Nodoka-chan!

Ritsu:
Thank goodness, we're saved!

Nodokai:
Hey, do you guys know where the train station is?

Mio:
So you guys are lost, too?

Nodokai:
Yes. But that was is north, so this should be the right street, don't you think?

Mio:
Probably.

Yui:
If we stick with Nodoka-chan, we'll be fine.

Mio:
We turn left here, right?

Tsumugi:
Think so…

Nodokai:
Ok, if we just follow this road, then we should be…

Ritsu:
We're right back where we started.

Nodokai:
That's so strange…

Mio:
Nodoka…

Nodokai:
Hmm, hang on. Let me check my map again.

Ritsu:
Oh, skull. Skull.

Mio:
[manic laughing]

Tsumugi:
I'm glad we made it back for dinner.

Yui:
Mhm!

Sawako:
Now listen, don't you ever worry me like that again!

Yui:
I'm sorry, m'lady.

Ritsu:
Yon rice for thou? I am Lady Akiyama on ye bass guitar.

Mio:
[manic laughing] I can't stop!

Sawako:
Hey, what are you two doing out here?

Schoolgirls:
Yes, ma'am. All right, we will. Goodnight, Sawa-chan.

Sawako:
Sawa--

Teacher:
I think we can afford to relax now. Tomorrow's just the train home.

Sawako:
True, but there's still one more night to get through.

Mio:
Ok, I'm turning off the light.

Yui:
Ahh, today was fun.

Mio:
Let's go straight to sleep this time, all right?

Yui & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
All right.

Ritsu:
Heh heh. Mio…

Mio:
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

Ritsu:
This long night of terror has only just begun, Mio-chan. Ahaha!

Sawako:
Keep it down!

All four girls:
[scream]

Sawako:
Now you hurry up and go to sleep.

Ritsu:
Who are you?

Sawako:
I'm your teacher! Even on a big trip like this, you four don't ever change!

Ritsu:
You're ten times scarier without your makeup, Sawa-chan.

Sawako:
What? I didn't quite catch that, Ritsu. Would you mind repeating what you just said to me?

Ritsu:
I didn't say anything and I didn't mean it!

Yui:
Oh! Eh!

Sawako:
Now everyone go to sleep.

Yui:
Come on, please? Can't we just chat like friends like we always do?

Sawako:
Look, Yui, I'm supposed to be your teacher now!

Yui:
Aww, just for a while?

Tsumugi:
I have tasty snacks, too!

Sawako:
You're always trying to snare me with--
It's all your fault that all the other students are calling me "Sawa-chan" now and aren't showing me the respect that I deserve as a teacher. You're ruining my image at the school. I've worked really hard on my "nice teacher" act, (and you guys go and--)

Yui & Ritsu:
We shouldn't have asked her to join us.

Yui:
[sighs] (I'm a senior now.)

Ritsu:
[snoring]

Yui:
Mm. (This is our last year as the Light Music Club, too. But I really want to keep on playing with all of them in a band. Forever… and ever…

Teacher:
Miss Yamanaka!

Sawako:
Don't scare me like that!

Teacher:
Mmmm….

Sawako:
[snoring]

Ritsu:
Anyway, I'd already been given a copy of that book.

Yui:
Mm.

Ritsu:
So I ended up giving it to my li--
Yui, Mt. Fuji!

Yui:
Ah, where, where?

Mio:
Oh, I wanna see, too! Hm? Oh, I dropped them.

Yui:
Hahaha, Mio-chan, you're just as bad as me!

Mio:
Oh… Hm, yeah, you're right!

All four girls:
[laughing]

ED

Preview
Ui:
Did you make it? Since you haven't called me, I'm just gonna assume that you were able to make it on time.

Are you at the station by now?

Um, pardon us.
Ui:
(Did you make it? Since you haven't called me, I'm just gonna assume that you were able to make it on time. Are you at the station by now? I hope you didn't forget anything.)
Ah,
(I was worried, so I went to your room to check, and it turns out you did. Have Mio and the others take lots of great pictures for you, okay?)
Have a great trip! See you soon.



Azusa:
Now right in Mt. Fuji. Can now see the bullet train. [Sighs]

Ui:
Sounds like my sister is having a great time! Good for her.

Azusa:
You know she' so scatterbrain because you keep coddling her the way you do, Ui.

Ui:
Oh, scatterbrain?

Azusa:
Well, she is a senior in highschool, but all she ever really does is hanging around clubroom and eat snacks. She never practices unless I yell at her.

Ui:
So you think she'd be better of if she was all strait-laced and proper?

Azusa:
Of course! If she had her head on straight, she...

Yui:
Knock it off! You're not playing and sing for the rest of the band!!

Azusa:
Senpai, I'm sorry!! [Sighs with grinning]

Jun:
Hey, what are you looking at?

Ui:
You mean, this? It's a text from my sister.

Jun:
Ah..[Chuckles] Wow, that's pretty funny. Your sister is so goofy.

Ui:
You really think so?

Jun:
Look, check it out. I just got a text from my senior. She's in a Jazz Club.

Ui:
Be sure to look after the freshmen.

Azusa:
She's got it together...

Ui & Azusa:
Huh?

Azusa:
Oh, it's from Yui senpai.

Ui & S:
Ah..

Azusa:
Remember to feed Tonchan, okay? ..They are so lame.

Jun:
Oh! In the Light Music Club, do you...?

Mio:
Today, we'll play Kick-the-can!

Yui & Ritsu & Tsumugi:
Yeah!!!

All:
[laughing in joy]

Ui & Azusa:
Hey, they are not that bad!!

Jun:
[Giggles]


Jun:
Oh, the elusive golden chocolate eclair!! This is my first time seeing one in two years!

Ui:
I never knew they sold them.

Jun:
Um. They only sell three. The seniors always buy them up before anyone else can. Ah..

Ui:
Ah. Jun, you should take a picture.

Jun:
Yeah, good idea!

Ui:
That's so cute! [phone buzzes] Ah, it's from big sis!

Azusa:
Hum? What's the matter?

Ui:
[Chuckles] Big sister left her lunchbox in her classroom, and she wants me to take it home for her.

Azusa:
Ah.

Jun:
Ahem, I'm getting a little embarrassed over here..

Ui:
Am, pardon us..

Jun:
It's so quiet.

Azusa:
Is it really okay for us to go in?

Ui:
We're just gonna pick up something our senior left.

Azusa:
Let's see, I think her desk is somewhere over there on that side of the room.

Ui:
Ah! You're right!

Jun:
Woa.. Hey which one is Mio senpai's?

Azusa:
Hmm, I think this is it.

Jun:
Oh.. Ha, I feel kinda cooler somehow.

Azusa:
You're imagining it.

All:
[Giggles]

Jun:
Hm? Pull me?

Azusa:
Ah! Don't touch that!

Jun:
What the heck?

Azusa:
Ritsu senpai..

Jun:
Huh? Where is Ui?

Ui:
This is my sister's desk..

Azusa:
Wow, she looks really happy.

Jun:
If you like your sister so much, aren't you gonna be lonely tonight?

Ui:
Huh..?

Jun:
She won't be home until the day after tomorrow.

Ui:
Ah.. You're right. Sis isn't gonna be home tonight...

Azusa:
You just realised that!?

Azusa:
No, don't cry!

Jun:
Don't worry, we'll go over to hang out with you tonight. We can even sleepover if you want!

Ui:
And so, Jun and Azusa will be spending a night at my house tonight. So I've decided to help out the Jazz Club practice in return.
Whoa, look at all the stuff!

Jun:
Ahaha, we have just as many instruments as the Brass Band Club!

Azusa:
Do you really have that many players?

Jun:
Pretty much.

Ui:
Amazing.

Jun:
Yep. It's about the survival of the fittest. So we had to practice hard where the upperclassmen are way, so that we're.. Ah! I forgot my base in the classroom!

Azusa:
She's gotta bring, too! Well, Jun never seem to change at all.

[Door opens]

Ah! We're..

Ui:
Sorry, we're friends of Jun-chan! She'll be right back.

Girl A:
Oh well well, are you Azusa senpai?

Girl B:
Jun senpai told us a lot about you. She said there was a amazing guitarist in the Light Music Club, and we should get lessons from her.

Azusa:
Ah... eh.. Oh, she did..?

Ui:
[Chuckles]

Jun:
Oh! Great timing, guys!

GirlA & B:
Good morning, senpai!!

Jun:
Good morning. These are two of the freshmen in the Jazz Club. Azusa, can you teach them a few guitar tricks?

Azusa:
Ah.. sure.
One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.

Girl A:
AH! Oh, I'm sorry.

Azusa:
It's okay. This part is a little tricky.

Girl B:
I can't get my fingers in the right position,

Azusa:
Um-hm. Well, there's some finger stretches that you can do. Firstly hold your code hand strait out with all your fingers pressed tightly together. Now split your index finger from your middle finger like this. Then pull it back to the middle and split your ring finger and the pinky in the other way.

Jun:
[Groans]

Azusa:
One, two and three, four. One, two and three, four.

Girl A&B:
[Groans] I can't do it! Ah They're cramping!

Jun:
Aw... Wait a minute, you can do it, Ui?

Ui:
Yeah, I copied my sister when she was doing her stretches.

Azusa:
If you're doing it in the bath or before playing, you'll find that your fingers will gradually become more flexible overtime.

Girls:
Okay!!

Jun:
[Groans in pain]

Ui:
What's the matter!?

Jun:
Uh.. What do I do!? My hand is totally seized up!
[Groans in pain] ...Pig feet! E..it was a joke.


Jun:
I'm here--!

Ui:
Come in!

Jun:
Good evening, Ui!

Ui:
Hi, come on in!

Jun:
Uh, this isn't really very much, but please accept this gift.

Ui:
Wow, Jun-chan, thank you. ....Ah, donuts, huh?

Jun:
Hum, they're Super All-star pack! I've always wanted to buy one.

Ui:
Jun-chan, this is so cute! Oh, come and see!

Jun:
Oh.. wow...

Ui:
Since there is going to be three of us, I thought I should make a lot. Now let's see... Ah, if this isn't enough, I also have sushi rice bowl and pizza.

Jun:
This will be plenty! It's more than enough.

Azusa:
Good evening!

Ui:
Come on in!

Azusa:
Ah, my mother said I should bring this for you.

Ui:
Ah! Thanks.

Jun:
Ah... What did you bring?

Azusa:
It's sushi, why? Hhm?

Jun:
My donuts are even lamer now...!!

Azusa:
[Take a breath]

Jun:
I'm full.

Azusa:
I can't eat another bite. ..Huh? Is that really how you eat donuts?

Jun:
I couldn't help it, I wanted to taste them all.. [stretches] Go ahead. Eat the rest of you want, Azusa.

Azusa:
I don't have any more room.

Jun:
Come on, there's always room for desert. That chocolate one is great.

Ui:
Ah, you're gonna eat one?

Azusa:
[munches] So sweet.

Ui:
Ah! It's from big sis!

Azusa:
Let me see!

[chuckles]

Ui:
Nothing's so school trip like a pillow fight.

Azusa:
Are you guys having fun? They'll sleepover too?

Azusa&Ui:
Huh?

Jun:
What's up?

Azusa:
Ah, Ow...

Ui:
Are you okay?


Azusa:
She's asleep.

Ui:
Wow, she's out like a light. I guess we should go to sleep, too. Oops, daisy.

Azusa:
But I don't wanna go to sleep yet.

Ui:
Okay, then. Why don't we just talk in bed? Lights out.

Azusa:
I bet Yui senpai and others are having a lot of fun right about now.

Ui:
Yeah, or they could be asleep already.

Azusa:
I really doubt it. When we had band camp, we would always stay up late goofing around. I'll bet..

Yui:
[laughing] (Souvenirs? Ah, we are having so much fun, we forgot!)

Mio:
(Yeah, sorry!)

Tsumugi:
(Our tea is ready!)

[laugh]

Ui:
Oh, Azusa-chan, I doubt it's that bad.

Azusa:
[sighs] They're so lucky.

Ui:
Hey, why don't we go somewhere tomorrow? Is there anywhere that you would like to go?

Azusa?
Uh.. ah, well maybe the zoo? ...I guess?

Ui:
Ah! I'd love to go to the zoo!

Azusa:
Really!?

Ui:
Yeah! ..Huh? It's from big sis!
...Hum? Skull??

Azusa:
What the...


Azusa:
[groans] Hey...

Ah, rain.

Ui:
Here.

Azusa:
Here.

Ui:
I have a fresh tube.

Jun:
I got.. this...

Ui:
Azusa-chan, isn't it a little high?

Azusa:
I think it's about right.

Jun:
I'm Jealous, Azusa.Your hair's so black and strait.

Azusa:
Really? People always say I look just like a Japanese doll, so I hate it.

Jun:
I'll take that any day. Mines always takes full efforts to brush out in the morning. Especially on the rainy days like today. See? It does this.

Ui:
Wow, that's an impressive frizz.

Azusa
Well, maybe you could just wear a hat today!

Jun:
Ahh...


Azusa
It's really coming down out there.

Ui:
Yea.. I guess the zoo plan is the bust.

Azusa:
Ahh, I really wanted to go. Jun-chan, what do you think we should do?

Jun:
Hm.

Azusa:
Is there anywhere that you wanna go?

Jun:
Um.

Azusa:
We could even play the video games.

Jun:
Um.

Azusa:
Humm.

Jun:
Ui, do you have volume 6 of this?

Ui:
Huh? I don't know, I'm not sure.

Azusa:
I think that if you do that at the friend's place, you are gonna lose that friend.

Ui:
You know, I think I might have seen that up on my sister's book shelf.

Jun:
So this is your sister's room, huh?

Ui:
Yeah.

Azusa:
Hey, aren't those...

Ui:
Oh yeah, she brought home tons of stuff a while ago for some reason.

Azusa:
They're from the club room cleaning.

Jun:
Ah! So this is Guiita? Whoa, this is so awesome!

Ui:
Let's see.. Ah! Found it! Here, Volume 7!

Jun:
Huh? But I needed volume 6.

Ui:
Really? But I only saw volume 7 on the shelf.

Azuse:
Skipping one is really no big deal.

Jun:
Ahem.. I guess.. I could read it. ..No! I thought I could, but I can't! Let's go to a book store and get it!

Ui:
[gasps]

Azusa:
But it's pouring outside.

Jun:
[moans]

Jun:
I feel bored out of my mind all of a sudden.

Azusa:
That's why I've been suggesting all morning that we should do something. Hm? Oh, It's Yui senpai.
So, what are you guys up to, Azu-nyan? Hmm...Come on guys! Let's go out and do something!!

Jun:
[breathing of sleep]

Azusa:
She's asleep now!?


Azusa:
Why did we come to a batting cage place..Uh!

Jun:
That was a baseball manga I was reading, so I had an urge to try it myself! ..Whow!! How do they expect this to hit that?
Hey, I'm gonna go play the crane game over there.

Azusa:
She gave up so quickly!
...Having any luck?

Ui:
Uh, No, this is pretty hard [all they]. [gasps]

A man:
Keep your eyes one a ball. Let it get really close. And picture a wall right about here. Swing! Okay, you got it?

A boy:
Yeah!

Ui:
Ah..! (Let it get really close. Picture a wall, and swing!) Oh, My!

A man:
[gasps]

A boy:
Whao.

Ui:
Ah, I did it! I hit it, I hit it, I actually hit it, Azusa! ...and she's gone.

Jun:
Boy, you sure pick things up quickly, Ui.

Azusa:
I guess you and Yui senpai have that in common.

Ui:
Huh?

Ui:
Thanks for waiting.

Jun:
Huh!? It's huge! That the home-run prize?

Ui:
Yeah.

Azusa:
That thing is ten times bigger than Ton-chan! Where in the world you're gonna put it? ...Huh?

Jun:
What's the matter?

Azusa:
Ton-chan... I forgot about him.

[panting]

Ui:
Thank goodness. He looks just fine.

Azusa:
I'm sorry, Ton-chan.

Ui:
[smiles] So this is Ton-chan, huh? I guess he IS kinda cute.

Azusa:
You heard he is cute?

Ui:
Yeah, my sister is always saying to me. Ton-chan is just as cute as Azunyan is.

Azusa:
[Smiles] He's cute like me? Hmm..

Jun:
Whoaa!! Here it is! I found volume 6!

Ui:
Good thing we came, huh?

Jun:
[giggles]

Azusa:
Hum.. Well I'm relieved that Ton-chan is okay. But still... When is this rain gonna stop?

Ui:
Yeah, our sunday is going to waste.

Azusa:
[moans]

Jun:
Why don't the three of us have a jam session then? It's raining out, and nobody's going to complain if we played really loud, right?

Azusa:
The three of us? Aha, yeah, that might be fun!!

Ui:
Oh, but I'm not sure if I'm good enough to jam with you.

Jun:
Don't worry. We'll just stick to easy stuff.

Azusa:
Yeah. You can play the organ, can't you?

Ui:
Ah, well I used to play when I was a little.

Azusa:
Let's play, let's play!

Ui:
Am, okay.

Azusa:
Jun, do you have any spare guitars in the Jazz Club room?

Jun:
You bet we do! Just wait right here.

Ui:
[smiles]


Azusa:
All right. Here we go.

Jun:
And one, two, three, four!

[Play a session]

Ui:
I did it!

Jun:
Wow, that song most sounded cool there! ..Look, the rain!

Ui:
Ah, wow!

three girls:
Aha..!

Ui:
Hang on a second. It's from sis!

Azusa:
Guiita, oh, how are yorn for thy?

Three:
[giggles]

Jun:
Come on Azusa, squeeze in closer.

Ui:
Ready? Here goes. Say cheese!
To my big sister, pretty cool, huh?

Jun:
Bye I'll see you guys tomorrow. Ui, remember volume 7.

Ui:
Sure thing.

Azusa:
Don't get too caught up in your book and miss your stop, okay?

Azusa:
She's gonna be alright?

Ui:
Today turned out to be a lot of fun, huh?

Azusa:
Yeah, it really was.
Huh? It's Yui senpai! Hello?

Yui:
Ha! Azunyan? Listen, we managed to get ourselves hopelessly lost.

Mio:
How is calling Azusa supposed to help us!?

Yui:
Oh! You're right.

Azusa:
Hum. So weird.


Azusa:
Ah, really?

Ui:
Uh-huh. Sis said that she is running really low on Azunyan energy.

Azusa:
Maybe I should hide..

Jun:
What's the matter?

Yui:
A--zunyan!! Aha, whao, it's been so long.

Azusa:
Come on! Cut it out! Not in the hallway!

Jun:
Is she always like this?

Azusa:
Could you please stop that!?

Ui:
Yep, always.

Yui:
Oh, right! We bought you a souvenir from our trip! Everyone's in the club room waiting, come on!

Azusa:
It can't wait until later?

Yui:
No, it can't! Mugi-chan has already made us some tea! See you guys later! [chucles]

Azusa:
Yui senpai!? Hey!!

Jun:
..Huh?

Yui:
Here, Azunyan?

Azusa:
Huh...? This is the souvenir?

Yui:
Yup! See? I have this one!

Azusa:
Uh?

Yui, Mio, Ritsu&Tsumugi:
[smiles] One, two!

Azusa:
Ah..! Then this is..

Ritsu:
MCL, that stands for "Music Club Light"!

Mio:
It does not!

Ritsu:
LMC! Light Music [C.....??? ]

Mio:
That's not it either!

Ritsu:
What!? Then next stop is..!

Azusa:
Light Music Club.

Ttsumugi:
[chuckles] Exactly.

Azusa:
Do you... wanna practice!?

Yui:
Oh.. Let's just all have tea today.

Ritsu:
We've got jet lag.

Azusa:
[groans]

Preview

Jun:
I think, this might be some kind of spell.

Azusa:
[gasps]

Jun:
A curse cast by someone out of hate for someone else.

Azusa:
No way!

Jun:
Who's a mystery witch?

Sawako:
Eh... Ms. Hirasawa!?

Nodoka:
What's the matter?

Yui:
It's a special occasion, so I wanna wear something different!

Yui:
Yeahhh.

Mio:
Wait! Why would you pick THAT of all things!!?

Yui:
Sheesh, everybody was enjoying it.

Nodoka:
You don't have to live up to the expectations of others.
Ui:
Big sis! If you don't get up, you'd be late! ..huh? Oh, she slept with Guita again?

Yui:
Mm.. Ui? Hm.. My arms are asleep for some reason.

Ui:
Did you fall asleep while practicing again?

Yui:
Yeah.. Hah.. Guita! Gooood morning!!

Ui:
Ah! Sis! Don't fall asleep again!

OP

Yui:
It's raining today, huh?

Ui:
The rainy season started, which means it's gonna be raining a lot.

Yui:
Ah! I've gotta make sure that Guita doesn't get wet.
Ui, could you hold my bag just a minute?

Ui:
Um, sure!

Yui:
Thanks a lot. There you go. Ready!

Ui:
Oh, you are like a couple!

Yui:
Yesh, you're right. Thanks for holding my bag.

Ui:
Yeah.

Yui:
And we're off.
I can't see where I'm going.

Ui:
Do you need help?

Yui:
No, I'm okay..


Yui:
Oh, man, I hate the rainy season.

Ui:
Guita is dry, but you're getting soaking wet!

Yui:
Ahhh!!
Oh, good bo...!!

Woman:
Ah!! So sorry!!

Ui:
Ah, big sis! Ah! Yui-chan..

Woman:
Oh, my...

Yui:
It's alright, Ui. What's important, is Guita is dry. All right, let's get moving, Ui.

Ui:
Oh, sis...
Oh, big sis...!

Mio:
It's been nothing but rain lately.

Ritsu:
Rainy season gets old real fast...

Mio:
Yeah, even with that great big umbrella, we always end up getting wet. ..Huh? Mugi, what are you doing?

Tsumugi:
[Groans] ..Nothing.

Yui:
Good morning, everybody.

Mio:
Hey, Yui.

Mio&Ritsu:
Good mo.. huh? You're soaked!

Yui:
Hehe.. Ui wiped up what she could with her hanky, but..

Tsumugi:
Oh, don't worry, I brought a towel with me.

Mio:
Wow, you're so prepared!

Yui:
Thanks a lot, Mugi-chan.
Down we go. And you stay here and be a good boy.

Himeko:
You really love him, like a boy friend.

Yui:
Uh? Nah, we wouldn't go that far.

Himeko:
All the best to you two.

Tsumugi:
So, Ms. Hirasawa, do you itchy anywhere?

Yui:
No, buy me nan! Oops sorry that's not how it goes. [chuckes]

Ritsu:
Okay now, what's with the weird routine?

Tsumugi:
We're playing a hair dresser.

Ritsu:
You love that, too? So what happened to you Yui, did you trip? You know what I mean, your usual shtick?

Yui:
No, I got drenched because I was trying to keep Guita safe and dry from all this rain. I don't know what happened.

Mio:
Why didn't you wrap in a plastic bag?

Yui:
Hey, you're right! You're so smart, Mio-chan!

Mio:
Normal people would have thought of that right off!

Tsumugi:
Well, your hair is dry, but erm..

Yui:
Oh! My hair is all ruffled up after I spent all morning setting it!

Ritsu:
Yeah, all this humidity is a real pain, huh? My hair looks like this every morning.

Tsumugi:
During the rainy season I spend all morning fighting with my hair.

Yui:
Um? You do that, too?

Mio:
Oh, that's why you were fussing over your hair.

Yui;
Guess we both have natural frizzy hair, huh?

Tsumugi:
Uh-huh.

Mio:
If they both have frizzy hair, why are they so different...

Yui:
[Sneezes]

Tsumugi:
Oh no. If you don't get your clothes dry, you're going to catch a cold.

Ritsu:
Let's hang them in the club room.

Yui:
Sorry for dragging you up here with me.
Ugh, my indoor shoes are all soggy, too. And now.. My tights are soaked, too.

Tsumugi:
I brought some hot water!

Yui:
Huh? You're gonna make tea?
I'm supposed to drink from the bucket?

Tsumugi:
No, silly. Warm up your feet with it.

Yui:
Oh, I get it. Thanks Mugi-chan!
Please pardon me then. Hah.. Uh... That's so warm...
[sighs] I feel like I'm in heaven. I don't wanna go to class now.

Mio:
Of course you're going to class!

Yui:
Yeh, you're mad.

Tsumugi:
Once you're warmed up, get out of those clothes. I'mma hang them up to dry.

Yui:
'Kay!

Tsumugi:
Welcome home, dear!

Yui:
Here, I just walked in the door.

Tsumugi:
Thank you.

Yui:
[Sneezes]

Ritsu:
Quit messing around, get changed!


Tsumugi:
Yui-chan! We hung up your clothes to dry.

Mio:
What are you doing?

Yui:
Huh?
I'm embarrassed that had Guiita see me in such a scandalous state!

Ritsu:
Yeah, whatever.

Yui:
Oh, what a tough club.

Ritsu:
What are you gonna do about change of clothes?

Mio:
There's no PE today, so we don't have our sweats.

Tsumugi:
Yeah, you're right.

Ritsu:
Hum.. AH! Those weird Sawa-chan's handmade outfits! The club's awful legacy.

Mio:
Oh, right, those. Um?

Yui:
Hhm! Yeahhh!

Mio:
Hey! Why would you pick that of all things!

Ritsu:
Where you've been hiding that thing anyway? We returned those to Sawa-chan.

Yui:
I like this one, so I kept it.

Nodoka:
Ah, Yui, there you are. You need to come back. Homeroom is about to start. You guys too.

Ritsu:
Wait. How did you know it was Yui in there?

Nodoka:
Well? It was giving off... eh, Yui vibe.

Yui:
You're so awesome, Nodoka-chan!

Nodoka:
Is that your spare outfit you have?　

Yui:
There are others, but..

Sawako:
Good morning, take your seats. Let's take attendance now.
Ms. Hirasawa. What in the world are you wearing?

Yui:
My uniforms are all wet, so had to change into this!

Sawako:
But, but.. a strange outfit like that isn't appropriate to wear for school!

Ritsu:
Come on, what are you talking about? You're the one who made that thing, Sawa-cha..![gasps]

Sawako:
Don't you have anything else?

Yui:
Well, am I..

Nodoka:
I'm sorry I'm late, Ma'am.

Nodoka:
I borrowed this sweat from a girl in another class.

Yui:
[moans]

Nodoka:
What's the matter?

Yui:
I was hoping that this would be a chance to wear something a little different.

Sawako:
Just go get changed!!

Yui:
Yes Ma'am!

Ui:
Hey, Azusa-chan! Did you find what you're looking for?

Jun:
What the heck is that?

Azusa:
I don't know.

Jun:
Who's are they?

Azusa:
I don't know...

Ui:
Hum? Ah, those are sister's tights.

Azusa:
Seriously, now! Who would hang all those clothes in here!

Ui:
I can't tell them!

Mio:
Uh..

Yui:
Damn. I can't crease these pleats!
Aw!

Mio:
Ugh!

Tsumugi:
Yui-chan, I'll do it! Let me!

Yui:
You will? Thanks...

Mio:
You're really good at that, Mugi.

Yui:
Yeah. Thank you so much!

Ritsu:
Yui.

Yui:
Yeah?

Ritsu:
One of your buttons was about to fall off.

Yui:
Really? And you put it back on for me?

Ritsu:
Um-hum. Here.

Yui:
Whoa... Thank you!

Mio:
For someone who hates fiddling instruments you sure can fix button quickly, Ritsu. Impressive.

Ritsu:
Ho, lay off.

Yui:
It's way too nice for me to wear..

Ritsu:
Gosh.

Ritsu:
Yui.

Yui:
Yea?

Ritsu:
You're going to wear that?

Yui:
No one would be able tell when I'm sitting down.

Ritsu:
I meant as a girl, you're gonna wear that?

Yui:
You makes like this all the time, Ritsu.

Ritsu:
I do! Don't I!?

Sawako:
What are you doing?

Yui:
Ah! Sawa-chan!

Sawako:
Take off those sweat pants, now.

Yui:
Hahhh?

Sawako:
And you need to tuck in your blouse, Ms. Tainaka.

Ritsu:
What!?

Yui:
You never cared about this stuff!

Ritsu:
What makes today any different from before?

Sawako:
Ugh. All right. Have I made myself clear ladies?

Ritsu:
Fine. Whatever.

Sawako:
Oh, good afternoon.

Senior teacher:
Good afternoon to you, too. You certainly have your hands full.

Sawako:
Oh, don't worry about me.

Senior teacher:
I'm not worried about you at all.

Sawako:
Ha ha...
Now, you, Ms. Hirasawa.

Yui:
I like it better this way!

Sawako:
No, and that's final!

Yui:
Even if my skirt flips and uncovered, and they..

Sawako
I said, to take them off!

Yui:
Aahh! Sawa-chan, please stop! Oh please stop..

Sawako:
Quit! They'll think I'm molesting you!

Yui:
Please don't, ohh!

Classmate 1:
Ah, costume's gone.

Classmate 2:
Too bad. Class won't be as fun.

Classmate1:
You're right.

Yui:
See? Everybody was enjoying it.

Nodoka:
You don't have to live up to the expectations of others.

Ritsu&Mio&Yui:
[chuckle]

Mio:
I can't believe. It's still raining.

Ritsu:
We're gonna get soaked again.

Mio:
Yeah, no kidding.

Nodoka:
It's supposed to rain tomorrow, too.

Yui:
I have to keep Guiita safe on the way home!


Azusa:
Oh, now I get it. That's what happened this morning.

Mio:
You didn't have any problems, Azusa?

Azusa:
No. I use the raincoat that's designed for carrying guitar cases in what weather.

Yui:
Um? Wow, they really make those?

Azusa:
Yeah. It really comes in handy.
I bought it online. But it was on sale. And it even came with the desiccant pack to help keep your guitar dry.
And I also bought this coating on for my guitar. See? It's guitar hanger you stick on a wall. It's shaped like an animal pow. Oh, and this is a strengthener to help you open your fingers wider.

Mio:
Whoa.

Azusa:
And I've got something else, too. I've got a CD that's supposed to help you develop your sense of rhythm if you listen to it while you're asleep!

Mio:
Azusa.

Azusa:
Yes, Mio?

Mio:
I wonder, has any of that stuff really helped?

Azusa:
Eh? Uh.. Hum... Ah, now I get why there were uniforms hung up to dry in the clubroom today. Jun actually said:

Jun:
I think, this might be some kind of spell.

Azusa&Ui:
[gasp]

Jun:
A curse cast by someone out of hatred for someone else.

Azusa:
No way.

Jun:
Why else would someone hung up clothes to dry in the music prep-room? Who's a mystery witch?

Azusa:
She had us so spooked with that.

Yui:
Ui, couldn't have yourself to say anything?

Azusa:
I'm really impressed, though. You rescued hard to protect Guiita!

Yui:
Heh.. More plaise me, more.

Azusa:
You should be careful, though. They say if you put your guitar away weather even dump, mold can start growing on the finger board.

Ritsu:
It does, does it? Your case will be all covered with mold!

Mio:
[screams]

Yui:
You know, I really don't think that Guiita would be a moldy and grosser or anything..

Azusa:
There's no mold, but I do see a little bit of rust on some of the strings.

Yui:
Well do you think I should put new strings on him?

Azusa:
When was the last time you restrung him?

Yui:
Two months ago.

Azusa:
Maybe you should, then. Do you have a new set of strings?

Yui:
Um-huh.
Don't bite, Guiita..! Whoaaaaaaa!! How dare you raise your hand to me!

Azusa:
You're supposed to loosen your pegs before you cut the strings.

Yui:
Oh! I forgot! Don't worry, our brand new strings are on you in no time, Guiita.

Azusa:
I think it's nice that you're taking good care of it, but you don't really need to speak to it like it's a real person, do you?

Yui:
Hm?

Azusa:
Uh?

Yui:
Are you jealous, Azu-nyan?

Azusa:
Dah!

Ritsu:
I sense a love triangle here.

Azusa:
Don't encourage her like that!

Mio:
Yes, a love triangle! Some lyrics like that will make a great song!

Azusa:
You too, Mio senpai!!

Yui:
Ah, you should have come out, and just said so in the first place.

Azusa:
Nooooooooooo!

Yui:
Ugh, I finally got all those strings changed.

Azusa:
Why you're acting so exhausted over that?

Mio:
Come on, why don't we practice? The rain's finally stopped, so it won't be so..

Yui:
Ha! It's stopped!? Hurry! Let's go home while it's dry out!

Azusa:
I thought we were gonna practice!!

Yui:
Guiita might get wet if we stay!

Azusa:
It's always Guitta this and Guiita that with you!

Yui:
Don't worry Azu-nyan, I will always have a place in my heart for you.

Azusa:
[gasps]

Ui:
[sighs] Everything's so crummy. Uh? Sis saved the half of that the day before yesterday. [gasps] It's moldy!　

Big sis! I've got tea for us. Ah! You've got mold on you! You didn't eat that moldy bun, did you!?

Yui:
No. I didn't eat the bun?

Ui:
But are those Tsumugi: flakes!?

Yui:
Oh, why you saw seaweed on my face?

Ui:
Oh, right. Your takoyaki lunch for today.
When is this rainy season gonna be done?

Yui:
Rainy days can be fun, too.

Ui:
Huh?

Yui:
You can just hang out inside the house and spend a whole day together.

Ui:
[smiles] I'm jealous.

Yui:
Huh?

Ui:
You seem so happy ever since you started playing guitar.

Yui:
But you know?

Ui:
Huh?

Yui:
Sometimes I worry about not being able to play something well. Or making Guiita look bad if I played a wrong code, or miss a beat, or really mess something up badly.
But whatever happens, all I wanna do is go and having fun and making music with him forever and ever! Here we go!

Yui&Ui:
[sings]


Ui:
Another rainy day.

Yui:
I got a cover today! Ta-dah!

Ui:
Aha! Great idea!

Yui:
Thank you.

[Cries] I can't get this plastic off!

Mio:
You went overboard.

Yui:
About done time!

Azusa:
Japanese weather can be awfully rough on musical instruments, can't it?

Mio:
That's for sure.

Azusa:
If the neck absorbs any moisture it'll warp and can make it really hard to tune properly.

Yui:
Wow, it will?

Azusa:
If you octave tune it, you can tell right away if there is a problem. First you do this.

Yui:
Oh! Let me check mine!

Azusa:
Uh?

Yui:
Oh! Hey you're right! It's off by a half of a half of a half tone!

Azusa:
You mean you can tell that without using a tuner!?

Yui:
Um-hm.

Azusa:
Wow, you're right. According to the tuner, it's off by half a semi tone just like you said!

Yui:
In that case, fix it for me!

Mio:
Just fix it yourself!

Yui:
But it'll take forever if I try to do it myself.

Azusa:
Yui, didn't I teach you how to do it?

Yui:
Heheheh..

Azusa:
Okay, just this once.

Yui:
Thank you Azu-nyan!

Ritsu:
This rain just won't let up!

Azusa:
It's getting worse.

Mio:
Yeah, and the wind is picking up, too.

Tsumugi:
The weather forecast said, it's gonna rain again tomorrow.

Mio:
Maybe, I'll just lay my bass in the clubroom overnight.

Yui:
That's so cruel, Mio-chan!!

Mio:
[screams] Wha, what is...!!

Yui:
Hm!

Mio:
Huh?

Yui:
I feel so sorry for you, Elizabass. Mio-chan is just abandoning you!

Mio:
I'm only leaving it here because I don't want it to get wet!! And please don't name my bass!!

Ritsu:
Why not you leave Guiita here, too?

Azusa:
That would be the smart thing. That plastic wrap you brought, isn't really usable.

Yui:
Good point.
Now, don't talk to strangers and get into their car or anything, okay?

Mio:
What are you saying?

Yui:
Elizabass, you're going to be spending the night with Guiita tonight, okay?

Mio:
I said, not to name my stuff!!!

Azusa:
She named that, because it is a bass. Mine's a mustang, so I guess that will make it... Mu-tan.

Tsumugi:
I think that's the perfect name!

Azusa:
Nahh!! Please don't read my mind like that, it freaks me out!!

Tsumugi:
You said that out loud, Azusa-chan?

Azusa:
[gasps]


Ritsu:
Oh well, what a downpour.

Azusa:
Aw, it's soaking through to my socks.

Mio:
Leaving our instruments was a right call.

Yui:
Well, well. See you guys tomorrow.

Azusa:
I'm off, too.

Tsumugi:
See you tomorrow.

Mio:
Sure.

Ritsu:
Be careful going home!

Yui:
Guiita, I only think about you.

Tsumugi:
Wait, Yui-chan!

Azusa:
Yui-senpai!

Ritsu:
She left Guiita behind and she's still getting soaked.

Mio:
Yeah, it seems like Yui is constantly fussing over Guiita, doesn't it?

Ritsu:
Well it's more like obsessing rather than fussing, really.

Mio:
She's making such a huge spectacle over leaving him at school.

Ritsu:
[laughs] Really? Like you're one to talk about Yui?
I seem to recall you coming to me in tears the first time your bass got a little scratch on it?

Mio:
Ritsu!!

Ritsu:
Where is it?

Mio:
[sobbing] Here.

Ritsu:
[laughs]

Mio:
Ah, ah, ah!!


Ui:
[yawns] I'm finally finished with my homework!
Whoa! What the heck, is that? I hope it's not burglars...
Big sister!

Big sister! There's a weird noise in the house said...huh? What are you doing?

Yui:
Ui...

Ui:
What's wrong?

Yui:
Ui...

Ui:
Big sis, are you okay?

Yui:
I'm so worried about Guiita being all alone at school that I can't sleep! [sobs]

Ui:
Oh that'll be all right, big sis.

Come to think of it, she's practiced on him every day since she bought him. They're even practically inseparable.

Yui:
Hah! I can't take it anymore! I'm going back for him!!

Ui:
Sis, don't do it! We're on the second floor and you're all in pajamas and it's raining!


Ritsu:
Yui only spent one night away from Guiita, but she's got a huge smile on her face.

Sawako:
I guess your guitar means awful a lot to you, huh?

Yui:
Yes!

Sawako:
That's understandable. But would you mind putting it away during the homeroom?

Yui:
Hah, don't mind him.

Sawako:
But I DO mind.

Yui:
Come on, just for a little while?

Sawako:
I said, NO!

Mio:
[panting]
It's here. Yui was so worried about Guiita that it made ME nervous, too.
Hm?

Ritsu:
[Your case will be all covered with mold!]

Mio:
Ugh...
What a relief! Oh, Elizabass... [chuckles] ..Huh?

Ritsu&Yui&Tsumugi:
[Giggle]

Mio:
[screams]


Preview

Mio:
Get it off me, get it off me!!!

Yui:
Now Mio-chan back scratcher!

Mio:
Stop making up crazy stuff!!

Ritsu:
And that, was when they first met.

Mio:
Whaa!

Ritsu:
But what fate, lies in store for them? So do I. First question. What's the absolutely scariest story you've ever heard in your whole life!?

Mio:
Huh!? What kind of question is that!?

Yui:
Next question. What the second scariest story you've ever heard?

Mio:
[screaming]

Ritsu:
What's the third scariest story you've ever heard!?

Nodoka:
Ah,

Mio:
Ugh, I've tried so hard to forget about all that.
Nodoka:
Here we go. Hm? Hey, this is... Dear Sokabe senpai, the weather has finally turned warm. How have you been? I'm writing to you today because there is something that I wish to tell you about.

Yui:
Huh? Mio-chan?

Mio:
Huh?

Yui:
What's wrong? You seem all fidgety.

Mio:
Well, I had this weird feeling all morning long that I'm being watched.

Tsumugi:
It's because you're really popular.

Mio:
No, it's not that, Mugi. It's almost like somebody is staring at me.

Yui&Ritsu&Tsumugi:
Stare....

Mio:
DON'T DO THAT!!!

Ritsu:
Sure you're not just being self-conscious?

Mio:
Ritsu, I'm serious!! I can feel someone's eye on my back at this very second...!!

Sawako:
Guess who! [Giggles]

Yui&Ritsu&Tsumugi:
Sawachaan...

Sawako:
Uh?

[EYECATCH]

Sawako:
Hum... So you feel like someone's watching you, huh?
Personally, everyone's eyes are always on me!

Ritsu
'Cause you've guised a really nice cover anyway.

Sawako:
Hey! What do you mean by cover!?

Ritsu:
Maybe you're the culprit who's been tailing Mio and creeping around.

Sawako:
As if!! If it were me, I wouldn't stop at just watching her.　

Ritsu:
Oh yeah, good point.

Sawako&Ritsu:
[laugh]

Yui:
I got it! The culprit is really Ton-chan!

Ritsu:
Huh?

Yui:
See? It's all because you're scared of Ton-chan. And always tried to avoid looking at him. So Ton-chan grabbed on your back!

Mio:
Get it off! Get it off!! It's no use. These people aren't gonna help me.

Azusa
Come on guys! I think you should show our room of more concern here. She might be the target of some creepy stalker!!

Mio:
Azusa...!

Tsumugi:
Now I see. I think I solved the mystery. The culprit.. uh.. is YOU!

All:
Huh?

Tsumugi:
I'm sorry guys. I always wanted to do that. But the part about solving the mystery was true.

Mio:
Hhm?

Tsumugi:
Mio-chan, you had a yakisoba bun for breakfast this morning, right?

Mio:
Y- you're right, I did! I overslept and didn't have time to sit down and eat breakfast like I usually do.

Tsumugi:
And that yakisoba bun was 20 percent off, wasn't it?

Mio:
H- How in the world did you know that!?

Tsumugi:
[giggles] From this! You see?

Mio:
Hhm? Hah!

Sawako:
Oh I get it, you've been walking around all day with that stuck to your hair!

Mio:
That's why everyone was staring at me..!

Nodoka:
What are you two doing out here?

Girls:
Aw!

Mio:
Nodoka, who are these two?

Nodoka:
I'm not--

Girl A:
Hey, we're not criminals or anything!

Girl B:
Yeah! We're just members of Mio-senpai fan club!

Nodoka:
The fan club..

Mio:
Aww, I came this close to forgetting about that picture...

Tsumugi:
Wait, you didn't come here to see the sticker in Mio-chan's hair, did you?

Girl B:
Yeah, we heard of that from the other members!

Sawako:
If you're her fans, why didn't you say something to her about it.

Girl A:
Well I did say to everyone that we really ought to tell her!

Girl B:
That having something stuck in hair like that is just so Mio and you're wonderful!

Ritsu:
Wonderful..?

Yui:
I was actually wondering if you had stuck that thing there on purpose!

Mio:
You mean you've known about it!??

Nodoka:
I'm sorry. It's because I've been so undependable to those two fan club girls.

Ritsu:
What are you apologizing for?

Yui:
Wow, I didn't know your fan club was still around.

Tsumugi:
Yeah. I thought it had disbanded after Sokabe senpai graduated.

Azusa:
Wait, Sokabe senpai, who's that?

Ritsu:
Oh, yeah. That's right, you've never met her.

Yui:
She used to be the president of the official Mio-chan fan club here at school!

Ritsu:
That's right! Oh, has it been so long since those events transpired!

Azusa:
What events?

Ritsu:
Well, it was March. Just before graduation.

Mio:
Hhm..?

Ritsu:
Mio was scared. Thinking that she was being constantly watched by someone. I couldn't bare seeing her like that. So I advised her to go talk to the student council about it.

Azusa:
Really? The student council?

Mio:
Dial down your imagination, okay?
Nobody took me seriously, so I decided on my own to go talk to the student council about what was happening.

Nodoka:
So you feel like there's someone always watching you? I wonder if the stalker. It's hard to believe there could be an intruder on campus, but.. ? Mio, why are you crying?

Mio:
I'm so happy that someone's finally reacting normally!

Nodoka:
How they're treating her in the Light Music Club.

Sokabe:
Ms. Manabe, are you there?

Nodoka:
Oh, senpai.

Sokabe:
Oh, we have a visitor?

Nodoka:
Is there a problem?

Sokabe:
Not at all. I brought a handover paperwork.

Mio:
Nodoka, who is this?

Nodoka:
Megumi Sokabe. Student council president.

Sokabe:
Well, former president. A pleasure Ms. Akiyama.

Mio:
Ah, same here.

Sokabe:
I suppose that a member of the light music club might not have heard of me.

Mio:
OH, Ah! I'm really sorry!!

Ritsu:
That was the moment that they first encounter! However, poor unsuspecting Mio had absolutely no idea what fate has in store for them.

Mio:
Lay off the creepy narration, will ya!?

Azusa:
So what kind of fate are you talking about?

Mio:
That's where it gets weird.

Sokabe:
Here. I'm afraid it's not as expensive as the light music club's tea.

Mio:
Not at all, this is fine!

Sokabe:
Well, a stalker. This is a rather serious matter. Ms. Manabe, will you please inform the disciplinary committee of this?

Nodoka:
Yes, of course.

Mio:
You don't need to go though all that trouble!

Sokabe:
It's no trouble at all. If a student at our school has a trouble, we wanna do everything we can to help them out.

Mio:
I wish my club president could hear you say that.

Nodoka:
Still, I wonder what sort of person would follow Mio around.

Sokabe:
A member of her fan club, perhaps?

Mio:
Ughh, you know about that?

Sokabe:
Oh, what's wrong?

Mio
Eh, nothing. It's just that you know an awful lot about the light music club. You even knew my name.

Sokabe:
...!

Nodoka:
Come to think of it, you also knew that the club has tea parties.

Sokabe:
[Gasps]

Sokabe:
Y- You, must have mentioned it to me, Ms. Manabe..!!

Nodoka:
I don't think I did.

Sokabe:
Really?? You didn't s.. well, ah, though, the light music club is rather famous around school...

Nodoka&Mio:
Hhm?

Sokabe:
Well, I should be going now! Good bye!

Nodoka:
Senpai. Wait, you dropped something.
Hh? Mio Akiyama fan club membership card...

Sokabe:
I found this in a hall earlier...!

Nodoka:
But Ms. Sokabe, your name was written on the front of it.

Mio:
[Oh no, I have to say something to break the tension!]

Mio:
[Gosh, is it possible that you're the culprit?]

Sokabe:
[Oh, right. As is!!]

Nodoka:
[laugh out loud]

Mio:
Ms. Sokabe, you couldn't be the stalker yourself, could you? Huh?

Sokabe:
I didn't mean to frighten you...!!

Mio&Nodoka:
Ehh!?

Sokabe:
I'm graduating soon, you know...? The thought of never seeing you again is almost unbearable.. I just.. couldn't help myself...!

Mio:
It's okay. I have to admit that I'm flattered to hear you say that. And embarrassed, too.

Sokabe:
Ms. Akiyama...

Nodoka:
Member number one?

Sokabe:
Yeah, that's right! I'm also the president of the fan club!

Mio:
[screams]

Azusa:
So you mean the student council president was actually the culprit?

Sawako:
She couldn't be open about it because of her position.

Nodoka:
I suppose.

Yui:
It was tough for her. That's why we all wanted to come up with a special something to do for her for her graduation.

Mio:
Yeah. So we...,

Nodoka:
The light music club asked us to come to the auditorium. I wonder why.

Sokabe:
To get even with me...?

Nodoka:
Hh, I doubt it.

Mio:
Sokabe senpai, congratulations-

All:
on graduating!

Mio:
I- ahm... Sakura High's Light Music Club, would like to play for you to celebrate your graduation. We hope you enjoy it.

All:
It's Fuwa Fuwa Time!

Ritsu:
One, two, one two three four!

Nodoka:
Senpai. Senpai! Senpai, they finished playing the song!

Sokabe:
Hh! What's the meaning of this! Using the auditorium without permission!

Mio:
Uh!?

Sokabe:
...Is what I'm supposed to say. Thank you all so much. It's the best gift I've ever gotten!

Yui:
She laughed a bit!

Sokabe:
To mark the occasion, please autograph this!

Mio:
[screams]

Sokabe:
Please sign it "From Mio-tan"!

Nodoka:
My image of our wise elder shuddered.

Azusa:
So did you sign it , "From Mio-tan"?

Mio:
I did...

Nodoka:
Sokabe senpai was totally ecstatic.

Azusa:
Membership card number 0001!?

Mio:
It's in your name, Nodoka!?

Nodoka:
You see, after you played...

Sokabe:
I've decided, that you should also take over as the fan club president.

Nodoka:
Thank you, but absolutely not!
I couldn't turn down this membership card, so I gave in and accepted the position. But I never had time for it. And never carried out any of my duties as president.

Yui:
Nodoka-chan.

Nodoka:
That's why I came today to ask a favor of you.
To ask if you would mind holding a tea party for the members of the fan club.

Tsumugi:
A tea party?

Nodoka:
Right. I could never look her in the eye if I don't at least try.

Yui:
You bet! We would be honored to help you, Nodoka-chan!

Ritsu:
Yeah! You're always helping us out, so we owe you!

Mio:
U-Ugh...

Tsumugi:
What sort of tea party do you think we should have!?

Mio:
Up to, Mugi!?

Mio:
Hey come on, let's all rational to this, okay?

Yui:
There has to be a cake-cutting ceremony!

Ritsu:
The bouquet presentation and the memorial album!

Mio:
What is this...!?

Azusa:
Why don't we do a Q and A period then?

Ritsu:
Great idea!

Mio:
[They're not listening... ]

Nodoka:
So is it alright to take you up on your offer and leave all the planning of the event to you then? I'll go and secure a venue for us and make the notifications.

Azusa:
I'll volunteer to make all the posters!

Tsumugi:
And I'll bring an extra large cake!

Mio:
You're way too into this!

Ritsu:
Let's go all out, and...[indistinctive chatters]

Nodoka:
With everyone's help, this is going to be an amazing tea party, Sokabe senpai.

Nodoka:
Things certainly seem to be coming together nicely.

Yui:
We're pulling out all the stuff for Mio-chan's fans! Mio-chan pencils, Mio-chan erasers, Mio-chan tissues, Mio-chan chocolates, Mio-chan bottle openers, Mio-chan chopsticks! And the Mio-chan back scratcher.

Mio:
Don't make weird stuff like that!!

Yui:
I just put the Mio-chan sticker on it.

Tsumugi:
It's simple, but don't you think it's cute?

Mio:
Why would anyone even want one...?

Nodoka:
Ui even made these cookies for the party.

Yui:
Yeah! And the Mio-chan cookies!

Azusa:
Ritsu senpai, don't even think about charging admission. I know that look.

Ritsu:
Hey! Don't make me sound like I'm some kind of miser!

All:
Hhm?

Yui:
Yees?

Girl A:
Excuse us. We have a special delivery for you.

Yui:
You do? Really?

Girl B:
Please, all of you help yourselves!

Girl A:
Here you go.

Yui:
Thank you very much!

All:
Whoa.

Yui:
Look, it's yakisoba buns!

Tsumugi:
And tea too.

Yui:
Mind if I eat now?

Azusa:
That was fast!

Mio:
Ah. Thank you.

Girls:
[gasps]

Girl A:
We're looking forward to the tea party!

Girl B:
Sorry we bothered you.

Yui:
Thanks again, guys!

Tsumugi:
So cute! [chuckes]

Nodoka:
I'm glad that everybody seems to be looking forward to it.

Ritsu:
Nodoka, is Sokabe senpai coming to the party?

Nodoka:
About that,

Azusa:
Huh!? She can't come!?

Nodoka:
I wrote a letter inviting her, but she said that her college club has a big trip that day.

Azusa:
So there's not much point is there.

Tsumugi:
Can we change the date?

Nodoka:
She insisted that since we've already announced that to everyone, we shouldn't reschedule the party.

Azusa:
No way!

Nodoka:
She said that her dream was to keep the fan club going strong and to get everyone excited about it . So, if the current fan club members having fun at the party, she said that, that's enough for her and she's happy.

Yui:
What a mature thing to say.

Tsumugi:
Well, she IS in college.

Ritsu:
So when she graduated, she also moved on from being a Mio fan, huh?

Azusa:
That can't be true! I bet that she just had conflicting plans and couldn't make it that's all!

Nodoka:
Yes. And maybe she just didn't want us to go to any special trouble on her account.

Mio:
When I - when I graduate from here, will I become as mature as her?

Ristu:
Just then, touching images of the happy days Mio spent with her friend flashed before her eyes.

Mio:
I said, to cut out the stupid narration!

Ristu:
Ha-ha!

Nodoka:
In that case, and in keeping with Sokabe senpai's wishes, let's go ahead with the dated schedule.

Tusmugi:
Here. This is the day's program.
Ritchan, you and Yui-chan will act as hosts.

Yui&Ritsu:
Aye, aye!!

Nodoka:
As far as the venue is concerned, we've gotten school's approval to decorate the music room. But, don't go overboard.

Mio:
[It's not in the program or anything but, maybe I should do something special for them, too.]

Nodoka:
Let's just keep it simple and informal. Okay, let's all run through the program together.

Ritsu:
Welcome everyone, the Light Music Club thanks you for coming here today for the inaugural Mio Akiyama fan club tea party! We will be acting as your masters of ceremonis today. My name is Ritsu Tainaka.

Yui:
And I'm Yui Hirasawa!

Yui&Ristu:
Have a great time everybody!!

Attendances:
[applause and cheering]

Azusa:
Wow, this is a great turnout!

Nodoka:
I think I see some familiar faces out there too. Ah! Ms. Sasaki is a member?

Ritsu:
Anyway, as we all know, life is an exiting journey but it's full of ups and down.

Girl A&B
[chuckes]

Yui:
Ritchan, that's a wedding toast, too.　

Ritsu:
So, let's leave us get it stated , Mio Akiyama fan club tea party started!

Yui:
Here comes our guest of honor! MIO AKIYAMA!!

[Cheering crowd]

Yui:
Mio-chan looks so cool!

Sawako:
But her uniforms, so boring!

Ritsu:
Don't worry, we'll play costume changes!

Mio:
No we haven't!!

Yui&Sawako&Ritsu:
[Moan]

Mio:
Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedules to...!!

Fan A:
Mio-chan bit her tongue!

Fan B:
That's cute, too!

Yui:
They're reading it all.　

Mio:
To, join us here toda...!! ...To join us, for a bite.

Yui:
Wow, Ritchan. She's a bigger hit than our skit was.

Ritsu:
Seriously..?

Yui:
And on that note, let's get the speeches short and get right to the cake cutting!

Tsumugi:
[chuckes]

Yui:
Go Mio-chan! This is your very very first act as a couple!

Mio:
Act with who!?

Yui:
Azunyan will be helping you!

Azusa:
Hah!?

[applause]

Yui:
And now, the cake and tea service will begin. And all your table candles will be personally lit by Mio Akiyama herself!

Mio:
Oh, my...

Azusa:
Senpai! We're ready for you over here!

Tsumugi:
Here, too!

Mio:
Heeeh!

Ritsu:
And now! We'd like to move on to our special event! We call it "100 questions with Mio Akiyama"!!
Oh, one more thing. Each time a question is answered, please extinguish one candle on your table, alright?
Okay, time for the first question. What is the scariest story you've heard in your life!?

Mio:
What kind of question is that!!?

Yui:
Next question! What is the second scariest story!

Ritsu:
Third question! What's the third scariest story you've heard?

Yui:
The next next next next question! What is the fourth scariest story!

Sawako:
They're playing tales of the terror?

Fan C:
Mio, hang in there...!

Fan D:
You can do it, Mio!

Fan E:
Mio-san...!

Yui:
Let's open the floor to you!　

Ritsu:
Who has a question to ask?

Fans:
Here! Here!

Fan F:
When you take a bath, what do you wash first?

Mio:
I- I wash the shower head...

Azusa:
She washes the bath!?

Fan G:
When you have grilled octopus, still start with the head?

Mio:
A cube cover...

Azusa:
Where is that!?

Ristu:
And now, let's move on to the next portion of our program!

Yui:
Let's have an intimate look back at the first half of Mio's life with the following slide show put together especially for this party!

Mio:
My life is half over at 17..?

Ritsu:
[chuckles]

A fan:
Oh wow, she looks so cute!

Sasaki:
Look at how much she's grown up...

A fan:
She's so cute I'm gonna burst!

Azusa:
Hey, is it just me or are these slides more about you than Mio-senpai.

Ritsu:
Dah, that's cause I got them from my photo album!

Azusa:
[sighs]

Mio:
Ah...

Ritsu:
Sadly, the end of this inaugural tea party is now upon us. As the grand finale, we of Afterschool Tea Time would like to play a..

Mio:
Wait.
Ahm.. There are something that I would like all of you to hear. I know I wouldn't be able to express feelings clearly. So I put them into lyrics instead.

Ritsu:
Oh! Big surprise!!

Mio:
Heart grabbing sugar. I'll make a caramel sauce for you, my beloved. Granulated in brown sugar. Maple, honey, and wasanbom sugar. A caramel sauce for you, my beloved. My heart is also caramel sauce. Even if I gets a little burned, your tender heat will make it taste delicious...!!!

Ritsu:
Figures. Not even Mio's fans can make heads or tails out of her lyrics.

Ritsu&Yui:
And now, it's time for our performance!

Ritsu:
And a new song of Aterschool Tea Time!

Yui:
It's called "Pure Pure Heart"!

Tsumugi:
Sshhh! Sshh!

[sing "Pure Pure Heart"]

Yui:
Everybody say cheese!

Ritsu:
Alright, look over here next, please!

Tsumugi:
And now over here please!

Ritsu:
You're all crowded in too close to Mio!

Yui:
Yeah, that's...[indistinctive]

Nodoka:
I wished Sokabe senpai could see how excited everyone here is.

Azusa:
Oh, hey.

Nodoka:
Hey, what are you going to do with that?

Azusa:
I thought I take I picture of this and send it to her.

Nodoka:
But I don't know her cell number.

Azusa:
Just look it up at the student council office!

Girl:
I'm gonna go buy something to drink, okay?

Sokabe:
Okay. [phone rings] Hm?
[Chuckles] They all just gave me another wonderful gift!

Nodoka:
Dear Sokabe senpai. Please be sure to come to the next tea party we have. I'm sure it will be another terrific one.

Preview

Yui:
[sighs]

Sawako:
This is your future, so give it a lot of thought, okay?

Yui:
It seems like, it's still so far away and it's real hard for me to picture it.

Mio:
Yui, you haven't decided on your life plans yet?

Tsumugi&Mio:
I know what you mean.

Azusa:
Really? 'Cause I'm completely lost.

Nodoka:
For now, just writing down whatever it is that comes into mind should be fine.

Yui:
Whatever comes to my mind? Get it!
Yui:
Hello turtle, Mr. Turtle, Mr. Turtle Hello. In all the world xxxx nothing walks as slow as you walk in how you go, Why are you, why are you Mr. Turle, why are you so slow.

Whoa..!!

Nodoka:
Hey, Yui, come here! Hey, come on!

Yui:
Ah, Nodoka-chan.

Nodoka:
Look, we're leaving to go on a walk now.

Yui:
Wait for me, wait for me!

Yui:
[Groans]

Nodoka:
What are you groaning about, Yui?

Yui:
Oh, hi! Nodoka-chan. I can't decide on my top school choice.

Nodoka:
What!? Did you mean you haven't submitted your life plan's questionnaire yet!? But, that was supposed to be in ages ago!

Yui:
But, but I'm not really smart about this stuff. And I don't really know which universities are good!

Nodoka:
Yui, at this rate, you really ARE gonna end up in NEET.

Yui:
This time that word sounds like an actual threat!!

OP

Yui:
Hmm.. I give up, I'll be a NEET. N E E T..

Nodoka:
Stop that, Yui.

Yui:
What about you? What did you put down for top school choice?

Nodoka:
Who, me? I put one of the national universities. I know it's a bit of the long shot, but.. I figured that I give it a try anyway.

Yui:
Cool! Then I'll put that down, too.

Nodoka:
What!?

Yui:
But I wanna go to the same school as you, Nodoka-chan!!

Nodoka:
[sighs]

Ritsu:
Hey, what's the ruckus? Let's go practice.

Nodoka:
The thing is, Yui still hasn't..

Mio:
Yui, you still haven't decided on a school yet?

Yui:
Mio, what school did you put down? What's your top pick?

Mio:
Well actually I thought I'd try for recommendations.

Yui:
Recommendations you.

Nodoka:
Yui, do you even know what recommendations are?

Yui:
No.
Where are you going, Mugi-chan?

Tsumugi:
To the women's university I told you all about.

Mio:
Oh wow, very prestigious!

Yui:
I'll put that one, too!

Nodoka:
Yui, will you just give it a rest.

Yui:
Is it hard to get into your school, Mugi-chan?

Tsumugi:
Well I suppose. I have the test prep guide, if you'd like to take a look.

Ritsu:
Let me see. AH! English!??

Yui:
My eyes are seeing flashes.

Mio:
Welcome to the real world.

Ritsu:
Fists, Japan! We don't need no speaking English here!

Yui:
xxx !

Ritsu:
We'll stand strong! We shall live by Japanese alone!

Yui:
xxx!

Ritsu:
Hahahahaha!

Mio:
If you flunk English in school, you'll get held back a year.

Ritsu&Yui:
[Gasp]

Tsumugi:
But on the entrance exam, you'll do find if you get good marks on some other subjects. See? It also has Japanese.

Yui:
Really? Right. Ritchan hand off!

Ritsu:
All-right! See. Select: which of the following auxiliary verbs is used in the same manner. Hum! Hm, hm. Hhm. I never learned any of this!!

Mio:
We covered that our freshman year.

Ritsu:
Ehh. But that's- that's- that's... IMPOSSIBLE!

Tsumugi:
Didn't you learn how to memorize auxiliary verbs with the song?

Yui:
The song?

Tsumugi:
Musu musu chi shi mu, Mashi ma ho shi..

Yui:
Ru rara ru sa su, Ri ri ri. Tsu nu tari keri tashi ta shi ke ke nu. Ranu beshi rashi mashi nari meri. Why are you why are you so tari gotoshi.
That's it, right?

Mio:
You see, you do know them.

Yui:
So, erm, what do I do with all those?

Mio:
What's the point of knowing the song, then!?

Yui:
So what school did you pick, Ritchan?

Ritsu:
I just wrote "Undecided". I mean, I have no idea what I wanna do with my life yet.

Yui:
Oh, right. I'll just put down "Undecided", too then.

Mio:
Is that a good idea?

Ritsu:
Our future can't be decided by a misery scrap of paper!

Yui:
Hail, man!

Sawako:
Ms. Tainaka and Ms. Hirasawa, please report to the staff room immediately.

Yui & Ritsu:
Ehh!?

Mio:
Of course it isn't.

Yui:
You guys just go on up to the clubroom without us, alright?

Ritsu:
What a hussle..

Nodoka:
Oh, brother.

Mio:
You sure have your hands full with her.

Nodoka:
You too, Mio. With Ritsu. She hasn't changed one bit from way back when she was a little girl. But believe it or not, she's improved a lot.

Mio:
And Ritsu can pretty much do anything she set her mind to.

Nodoka:
It's the same with Yui. She can have amazing focus.

Tsumugi:
Hey, could we please continue this up in the clubroom?

Mio:
Wow, what are you suddenly so amped up about, Mugi?


Azusa:
Good afternoon.

Mio&Nodoka&Tsumugi:
Good afternoon.

Nodoka:
Pardon me intrusion.

Azusa:
That's summon was for Yui senpai and Ritsu senpai, right?

Mio:
Yea. They brought it on themselves though.

Azusa:
Oh, did they do something again?

Nodoka:
Again?

Tsumugi:
Erm, it seems like they were being called in to discuss their future plans, that's all.

Azusa:
Huh..

Tsumugi:
Here is your tea, Nodoka-chan.

Nodoka:
Thank you, Mugi.

Mio:
I've been wondering, when did you and Yui first meet each other?

Nodoka:
Way back in kindergarden.

Tsumugi:
Goodness, so how did you two meet?

Nodoka:
Well, there really wasn't anything special about it, I guess.

Yui:
Wanna draw together?

Nodoka:
Un, okay.
Before I knew it, she was sitting there next to me.

Mio:
Maybe she knew instinctively that she can count on you.

Nodoka:
Un? Yui, are you done already?

Yui:
Ha ha, yours looks so yummy!

Nodoka:
Yes it does.

Yui:
AAhhh..

Nodoka:
No! Don't eat that!

Mio & Tsumugi & Azusa:
[chuckle]

Mio:
She was like that even as a baby?

Nodoka:
Right. We ended up being in the same class at school every single year after that. We definitely have some sort of strange connection.

Azusa:
I bet that she's caused a lot of troubles to you, hasn't she?

Nodoka:
Huh. Well, not sure you could really call that trouble..
We went camping one time in grade school.

We were supposed to bring instant meals.

Yui:
AH! Ahhhh...

Azusa:
That's sounds like her all right.

Nodoka:
And there was this other time when we were making takoyaki in home ec. We were each assigned an ingredient to bring from home.
'Kay, I'm ready for the octopus.
Yui was in charge of bringing the octopus, but she'd forgotten it. We ended up making octopus-free takoyaki.

Yui:
Hah! Even without octopus, it's really good!

Mio:
[chuckes] Octopus free!?

Nodoka:
You know I could tell you the stories about stunts she's pulled until the cows come home. But when you see that innocent look on her face, you just can't help but forgive her everything.

Tsumugi&Mio:
I know what you mean.

Azusa:
You do? Because I'm completely lost.

Nodoka:
By the way, when I told you earlier that in spite of everything, Yui had improved quite a bit, I think that it's all because of the Light Music Club. So thank you.

Tsumugi:
Nodoka-chan, you're so mature!

Mio:
You sure are. You're almost like a mummy!

Tsumugi&Azusa:
A mummy?

Mio:
Ah, Uh! I meant. mother!!

Sawako:
This is your future we're talking about, so put some thought into it.

Ritsu:
Oh right.

Sawako:
And you still can't decide, Yui-chan?

Yui:
It seems like, it's so far off in the future that it's hard to picture it.

Sawako:
Well it's not far off at all. It's almost here.

Ritsu:
That's explains why you keep looking older!

Sawako:
Did you say something.

Yui:
Ahh, sawachan. Hey, you know you looked like that back in high school, so what is it that made you wanna become a teacher?

Sawako:
Eh.. well, uh... that's..

Yui:
Oh! What is it, what is it!?

Sawako:
Uh..It's a little bit embarrassing.

Ritsu:
We wanna learn from your example, so tell us everything!

Sawako:
There was this boy I liked, and he said he wanted to be a teacher someday. And I said "So do I"!!

Ritsu:
Talk about impure motives.

Yui:
So what eventually happened between you and the boy?

Sawako:
He just dumped me! [sobbing]

Yui:
Yeah. But thanks to that boy, you went to college, and got your degree, and became a great teacher, right?

Ritsu:
Yeah! I mean it's not the past that counts, it's the here and now, Sawa-chan.

Yui:
But you don't have a boyfriend at here and now, either.

Sawako:
[cries]

Mio:
Oh. So, how did it go, Yui?

Yui:
Well, we learned one more thing about Sawa-chan's interesting past!

Mio:
Oh? So she didn't chew you two out?

Ritsu:
See guys, you never really know what the life hold for us, do ya?　

Mio:
Wait, you didn't pull another one of your stunts, did you?

Ritsu:
No, no. I just mean that whenever life throws you for a loop, it can make you stronger.

Nodoka:
Then, she was okay with your future plan's questionaire?

Yui:
No, one bit.

Tsumugi:
Isn't there anything you wanna be when you grow up?

Yui:
Something that I wanna be... Huh. Mio-chan, what do you think I should wanna be?

Mio:
Decide it for yourself.

Nodoka:
Hmm... Back in middle school, didn't you say that you wanted to be a kindergarden teacher?

Yui:
That's right, I did!

Nodoka:
I think it was when we were reading our essay on the topic of our future dreams in front of the class.

Yui:
My dream of the future is to be a kindergarden teacher someday. I wanna become a kindergarden teacher and playing with kids all day until they go home.

Classmates:
[laugh]

All:
[laugh]

Mio:
Sounds like Yui.

Ritsu:
Speaking of reading essays in class, there was this one time when Mio actually won an award.

Mio:
NO! You can't tell them about that!!

Tsumugi:
Oh, tell us!

Yui:
Yes, please!

Mio:
A-Azusa! Let's go and practice, okay?!
AH! Ehh..

Ritsu:
You're not getting out of this one, Mio. Give it up.


Ritsu:
Even back in grade school, Mio was a quiet mild mannered girl. She always seemed to have her nose in a book.

Mio:
"Huh?"

Ritsu:
"Hmm."
And that's when.
"Hey! What are you reading!? "
She was even more shy back then than she is now.
"Com'on! Let me see, let me see! "
I love seeing her reactions.
"Wow, Mio-chan! You're great at drawing!"
I was teasing her constantly.
"Wow, Mio you got a handred!!"

Yui:
You're so lucky Ritchan, I wish I could have teased her, too.

Azusa:
Don't you think that was more like bullying?

Ritsu:
No. Totally different! In gradeschool you always tease the kids you like. Everybody knows that. It's just what you do. But we don't really get along all that well at first, did we, Mio?

Mio:
Of course not that I felt that's teasing you did to me! I'm getting ticked off just by thinking about it. Now, show me your forehead.

Ritsu:
Uh, what are you gonna do? ...Huh? My forehead.

Mio:
Relax. It's a water based marker.

Nodoka:
So tell us, what exactly happened when you were reading your essays?

Mio:
Oh, you remember that.

Ritsu:
Oh, let you know Mio. Just tell them the story.

Ritsu:
???

Mio:
We were in the fourth grade, and I received an award from my prefecture for my essay. But all the award winner had to read their essays in front of everyone at an all school assembly. I was depressed, because I didn't wanna read mine. And that's when...

Ritsu:
"What's wrong?"

Mio:
"Uh.."
Ritsu came up to talk to me.

Ritsu:
"You don't wanna read your essay at the assembly? But why not? "

Mio:
"Because I'm really embarrassed."

Ritsu:
"Don't be embarrassed, Mio-chan! You're awesome! "

Mio:
"I am not! I'm just regular.."

Ritsu:
"Mio-chan, you're the only one in the whole class to get an award! If it was me, I would be rubbing it in everybody's face! "

Mio:
"Then you should one of us taking an award 'cos I don't want it! I don't want to go in front of everyone and read it..!! I-I'm so sorry... "

Ritsu:
"Whao. I didn't know Mio-chan could yell so loud. That's... So cool!! Hey, come to my house for some.. special training! Just come on! "
"Without further ado, grade four class one, seat number one, Mio Akiyama! "

Mio:
"But I can't do it...!"

Ritsu:
"Is the platform too low? Want me to make it higher?"

Mio:
"No, it has nothing to do with that!"

Ritsu:
"Hmm.. Oh! Give me just a minute. First off, take this off, and do this... Sorta like this, I guess. Right! Okay, well done! "

Mio:
"What are you doing?"

Ritsu:
"I'm a pineapple! My dad told me that whenever we're nervous, just imagine that everyone in the audiences are big fat potatos! But I have no idea how to do a potato impression, so instead, pineapple! Look at me, Mio, pineapple! "

Mio:
"Haha! No you're not! "

Ritsu&Mio:
[Chuckle]

Mio:
"And so, it was passed down, from one person to the next. The end. Grade four, class one, Mio Akiyama. "
Thanks to Ritsu's help, I was finally able to relax.

Tsumugi:
What a wonderful story!

Azusa:
Wow, you used to be really nice, Ritsu-senpai.

Yui:
That's so out of character for you, Ritchan.

Ritsu:
Geez! Don't you two even know how to compliment someone!!?

Azusa:
So, did Mio's essay go over well? Everybody really like it?

Ritsu:
Well, it was something that Mio wrote, so it had a serious fairy tale vibe.
[Itchy, itchy, itchy....!!]
You can just imagine.

Azusa:
Yeah.

Mio:
But it was right after that, that I started going over to your house all the time, Ritsu, you remember?

Ritsu:
Yeah. And I started teaching you all sorts of cool stuff, didn't I?

Mio:
Right. Lots of things.

Ritsu:
To overcome shyness, you've gotta learn to have some self-confidence okay?
You start with how you speak. If you say "dude" at the end of sentences, you sound confident.

Mio:
Uh, my name is Mio Akiyama, duuude.

Ritsu:
Good, good. Just like that!

Mio:
Lots of things.
You didn't teach me anything that wasn't rude or crude. Maybe I should never have gone to you for help back then.

Yui:
Oh, that's so mean, Mio-chan!

Mio:
You said mean things to her just a minute ago.
But, I am grateful to her for introducing me music, and playing in the band, I guess.

All:
Mio-chan!!!

Mio:
Hey! We weren't talking about me and Ritsu! We were talking about what to do about you and your futures!

Yui:
Ah, uh..

Nodoka:
Yeah she's right . Don't try to think of anything specific first. Just start out by thinking of very general terms of what you might wanna be.

Yui:
Okay. Then a florist maybe?

Azusa:
Hey, that sounds like a good thing to be.

Yui:
Hi, I'm Yui Hirasawa. The town florist.

A customer:
Hmm, is this type of flower difficult to care for?

Yui:
No idea.

Azusa:
Right. You need to know about plants to do that.

Yui:
Then how about an office worker at some company!?

Azusa:
Hmm...

Yui:
Hi, I'm rookie office worker. I'm getting late today.
I'm sorry, I'm late! I overslept! Ah.

Man:
You work at the company that's two doors down the hall, Ms.

Yui:
R-Right! Sorry, bye!!

Azusa:
Anything with fixed hours might be a problem.

Yui:
That was mean, Azunyan.

Ritsu:
Being a bus tour guide might be fun!

Yui:
Yeah, I can go to all sort of places free!

Azusa:
That might work.

Yui:
I'm a bus tour guide. Now, everyone look at the right of the bus, you'll see, Umm..

Azusa:
That might be a bad idea for someone who gets carsick.

Ritsu:
Hmm..
What about trying a waitress?

Yui:
Hehehe, I'm a waitress.

Mio:
They have to remember big orders all the time.

Ritsu:
How about a pastry chef?

Yui:
Look! I'm a pastry chef!

Tsumugi:
I think she'd eat everything herself!

Ritsu:
Yeah. You have a point there.

Nodoka:
For now, I think you should just put down the very first thing that comes to your mind.

Yui:
The first thing that comes, huh?
RItchan! I got it!

Ritsu:
Yeah!! Ahaha!

Sawako:
Rejected.

Yui&Ritsu:
What??

Ritsu:
What's the deal?

Yui:
We fill that out, didn't we?

Sawako:
Huh.

Yui:
The mission was the failure, commander!

Nodoka:
So you wrote, musician?

Mio:
You should take this seriously!

Ritsu:
But we were being totally serious, Mio?

Nodoka:
[manic laughter]

Yui:
Geez! Nodoka-chan is laughing at us!

Azusa:
But not because it's funny.

Yui:
You see, this whole thing was actually an elaborate gag designed by Ritchan and I to make Nodoka-chan laugh!

Mio:
You know they're never gonna buy that story, Yui.


Yui:
Ui, what are you gonna do after you graduate?

Ui:
[I can't tell her. I can't say that I want to go to the same school as her because I worry about her. ]
Uh, I really haven't thought that much about it yet.

Yui:
Oh. Well, you need to give it a lot of thought before next year.

Ui:
How about you, sis?

Yui:
I'm thinking about it right now.

Ui:
Ah! She hasn't decided yet!

Yui:
Huh.

Classmate A:
Well, I always wanna be a beautician. So i'm going to go to a beauty academy.

Yui:
Oh, okay.

Classmate B:
Art university. I'm gonna go study photography.

Yui:
You mean there're schools for photography?

Classmate C:
University of foreign study. So I can study in China.

Yui:
Huh.

Classmate D:
I decided to go to nursing school.

Classmate E:
Help run my family's liquor store.

Yui:
Hmm. And what should I ever to put down?

Nodoka:
Hhm.

Yui:
Please do me honor of accepting this!!

Sawako:
Hmm. [cough] Rejected.

Yui:
Thank you for your time.

Nodoka:
Huh.

Preview

Ritsu:
Oh. What the heck is wrong, Sawa-chan?

Sawako:
I'm having big time to

Yui:
That might just work!

Azusa:
I don't know who I am anymore.

Granny:
Yui-chan.

Yui:
Ah! Granny!
Thank you so much! Thank you for always look af..

Granny:
What are you doing now?

Yui:
Hehehe..
Yui:
Ready!

Ui:
Sis, you be careful out there.

Yui:
Um. I'll see you later Ui!

Ui:
You have a good run!

Yui:
Oh? Hi, good morning, granny!

Granny:
Good morning Yui. You're up early today?

Yui:
I just thought I should work really hard and give 100%

Granny:
Oh well, good for you, dear.

Yui:
Hehehe. See you later!

Granny:
Oh, goodness.

--

Ritsu:
Well, there she is.

Tsumugi:
She's the definition of youth.

Ritsu:
She's cutting it real close.

Nodoka:
Yui! Hurry up!

Ritsu:
What part of hurry doesn't she get!?


Yui:
Made it just in time..

Ritsu:
Oversleep again?

Yui:
I got up early so that I could go jogging.

Mio:
You mean that's why you were late?

Yui:
I wrote on l my future plans’ questionnaire that I’d work hard.

Tsumugi:
Hm! Keep up, Yui!

Ritsu:
Please don't encourage her like that, Mugi.

Mio:
That's true, our finals are coming up pretty soon.

Yui:
Really..?

Teacher:
On a side note, Tadamasa Oguri's contribution can not be understated...

Mio:
She's already asleep.

Ritsu:
Gonna work hard, are ya??

Yui:
I'm gonna hit the books hard!


Yui:
Oh! You have such a tidy handwriting Mugi-chan. Could I..?

Tsumugi:
Would you like to make copies?

Yui:
Yes, thank you.

Mio:
Uh? Um..

Yui:
Ha! Oh wow your notebook is so cute Mio-chan!

Mio:
Leave me alone.

Yui:
Hm? Ritchan.

Ritsu:
Hm?

Yui:
I see that you too fall asleep during class. My source is there.
Hmm. It starts with Ta with Ki in the middle and it ends with N?

Ritsu:
A hint, it's a kind of food!

Mio:
Tanuki-udon.

Tsumugi:
Whoa, what kind of food is that?

Ritsu:
It's a whole raccoon in a bowl of noodles!

Tsumugi:
Whoa.

Mio:
You know we aren't gonna get any studying done at all.

Yui:
Hm? Aha!

Thanks a lot, Mugi-chan.

Ritsu:
Yui, Mugi! Open wide!
Try one of these hyper ultra sadistic mints! Here.

Yui:
It's a ---!

Tsumugi:
My tongue is numb!

Mio:
What are you guys doing?

Mio:
Are you sure that you'll be able to study on your own?

Yui:
As soon as I get home I'm going to work!

Wha. Hi granny!

Granny:
Oh, hi, Yui-chan.

Yui:
I'm back from school.

Granny:
Welcome back. Here I have some chicken stew for you. I made plenty this time, so you and your sister can have all you like.

Yui:
Thank you so much. Than you for always..aw!

Granny:
What are you doing now?

Yui:
Heheheh..

Granny:
Are you still playing.. what's it called?

Yui:
Oh, Guita?

Granny:
Yes, that was it, Guita.

Yui:
He's Guita the guitar!

Granny:
You're stuck with it ever since you started high school. It's nice to see you working hard at it, Yui-chan. Good for you.

Yui:
I got complimented.
Granny's looked out for me for a whole life.

Ui:
Sis, dinner's ready.

Yui:
AH! Oh no, I was working hard on a wrong thing!

Ui:
This is great!

Yui:
Yeah! I wanna do something to thank her.

Ui:
You know, I shared the souvenir you brought back from your trip to Kyoto with her.

Yui:
You really worked neighbors.

Ui:
Yeah, I guess. Maybe I'll bake a bunch of cookies and take them over.

Yui:
Whoa, your cookies!

Ui:
After we're done with finals!

Yui:
Ah! Hmmm...

I'm gonna work really hard on this!

Ui:
Sis?

Azusa:
Yui sempai's actually applying herself.

Ui:
Yeah, though she gave up on jogging after just one day.

Jun:
I bought shoes but never actually run in them.

Azusa:
Well that's even worse. ..Huh?

Ui:
See?

Azusa:
Oh.

Ui:
Of course, she did fall asleep at her desk last night.

Azusa:
It is Yui sempai after all.

Yui:
Whoa, sale season is here isn't it?

Tsumugi:
Sale season?

Yui:
Seasonal items are all on close-out, so the stores sell them really cheap!

Tsumugi:
Wow it's very dynamic!

Ritsu:
After finals, I wanna come here and buy some clothes.

Mio:
That sounds pretty good.

Yui:
OHhh! Every one of these tops are 30% off!

Ritsu:
You've got some questionable taste, lady.

Yui:
Ummm.

Ui:
Ah!

Yui:
Huh? What's wrong, Ui?

Ui:
We're out of soy sauce.

Yui:
I'll go buy some!

Ui:
That's okay. I'll go and get it.

Yui:
But you're in the middle of cooking dinner, aren't you!?

Ui:
Hm. Well, can you get it ASAP then?

Yui:
Yeah!

Ui:
Are you sure?

Yui:
No problem!

Ui:
Remember, we need soy sauce!

Yui:
Soy sauce, soy sauce, soy sauce, not sweet sauce, just soy sauce! Not just any sauce, but soy sauce...

Granny:
Yui-chan!

Yui:
Hi, granny! Thank you for the stew, it was delicious!

Granny:
You're welcome dear. Are you off to run an errand right now?

Yui:
Yes, we ran out of sugar!

Granny:
Oh, dear. Here you are.

Yui:
Thank you granny!

Granny:
Your timing was perfect. I want to tell about something. Here, take a look at this.

Yui:
A talent show?

Granny:
They hold it every year but apparently there are very few contestants this time around.

Yui:
That's to bad.

Granny:
Would you be interested?

Yui:
Huh? Who, me?

Granny
I think the shopping center people would love to see a young person competing in their show.

Yui:
Hm.

Granny:
And not only that my dear. I'd love to see you play your Guita too.

Yui:
What's the date? (The day after final exams end...!)

Granny:
Oh my, you have plans?

Yui:
Mm-m!

Granny:
I wonder if Shige-san perform this year. His magic performance is so much fun to watch.

Yui:
Maybe, I will.

Granny:
Do you mean it?

Yui:
Um! I'll play for sure!

Granny:
Wonderful! Oh, thank you, Yui-chan..! I can't wait to see you all dressed up on the stage.

Yui:
Right!

Granny:
I almost forgot. The grand prize is a trip to a hot spring! You should take Ui-chan.

Yui:
It wasn't sugar was it..?

Ui:
No...

Yui:
I wish I had soysause for this.

Ui:
We have ponzu sause.

Yui:
No, I don't like sour stuff.

Ui:
You're the one who mixed them up.

Ui:
Do you want me to tell her you can't play? I need to return this anyway.

Yui:
Um-hm! Granny was looking forward to seeing me play!

Ui:
But the show was the day after your final! Isn't it gonna be tough to rehearse and study?

Yui:
I'll work hard at both!

Ritsu:
A talent show?

Yui:
Yeah!

Tsumugi:
Sounds like a lot of fun!

Mio:
But it's a day after exams.

Yui:
That's why I'll perform by myself!

Mio:
Huh?

Yui:
You guys all have studying that you have to do.

Mio:
So do you.

Tsumugi:
Will you really be alright playing all by yourself?

Yui:
I promise that I'll work hard at everything!

Ritsu:
More to the point, why don't you just bow out?

Yui:
'Cause I wanna make a nice old neighbor lady happy.

Tsumugi:
Old lady?

Yui:
She's looked after me and Ui since we were little. And I wanna repay a favour.

Ritsu:
Huh.

Yui:
She said she wants to see me all dressed up on the stage. I'm gonna win, and give her this hot spring trip as a thank you present.
You know, now that I think about it, she sort of reminds of you, Ritchan.

Ritsu:
Reminds you how!?

Tsumugi:
That's great.
You're like the turtle in "Turtle Urashima", or the statues in "Kasajizo"! I adore stories like that.

Mio:
Fairy tales..?

Tsumugi:
Hang in there. If there's anything I can do to help, I will.

Yui:
Yeah? Some sweets to keep me going will be really nice.

Mio:
Hey.

Ritsu:
So, what are you gonna do for the show?

Mio:
You're not gonna do a talent show act?

Yui:
Look, the spinning plates!

Mio:
Like that, are you?

Yui:
No. Guita and I are going to do a nice solo song!

Ritsu:
A Yui solo?

Tsumugi:
I can't wait!

Yui:
Hehehe.

Ritsu:
Yui's launching a solo comedy act?

Mio:
All funny man and no straight man.

Ui:
I'm playing a song, not doing a stand-up!

Teacher:
Set!

Azusa:
She's playing in a talent show now?

Jun:
She's confident!

Azusa:
It probably just means that she isn't thinking.

Ui:
That might so a lady next door suggested it to her. And she agreed to do it.
Sis is really excited.

Azusa:
Hmm.

Azusa:
Ah! Yui sempai.

Yui:
Hum? Oh, hey Azu-nyan!

Azusa:
You're practicing your guitar out here?

Yui:
It's against the rule to use the music room before the tests.
And I thought that it would bother Ui if I practiced at home.
Are you out running errands?

Azusa:
Yes.

Yui:
Just make sure you don't mix up soy sause and sugar.

Azusa:
Huh?

Yui:
It could happen to anyone, you know.

Azusa:
Not really.
So, you're really going to play at the talent show?

Yui:
Oh, Ui told you?

Azusa:
Yes.

Yui:
Hehe, it'll be my first solo performance! I'm really nervous..

Azusa:
So you're playing alone?

Yui:
Yeah, why not?

Azusa:
Well, what about the club?

Yui:
We're in the middle of finals, so I didn't wanna bother anyone with helping me on this.

Azusa:
Sure you can handle it?

Yui:
Yup!

Azusa:
Well you're studying for the final exams?

Yui:
I'll work really hard!

Azusa:
Hmm. I understand. I'll enter the contest with you.

Yui:
Are you sure!?

Azusa:
I always keep up with my studies and I'm doing well on my classes, so I'm not worried about finals, I think.

Yui:
Whoa...! Thank you Azu-nyan!

Azusa:
Anyway, we need to pick a song and start practicing it.
We'll get down to work starting tomorrow, okay?

Yui:
Okay!

Mio:
Azusa's playing with you?

Yui:
She is!

Ritsu:
You know, we were all thinking about joining with you too.

Tsumugi:
You two performing should be great!

Yui:
Hehe.

Azusa:
Yui-sempai!

Yui:
Azu-nyan! Hey there..!?

Azusa:
I worked up a full schedule for you!
First thing up we're studying in the library.

Yui:
Azu-nyan, what about snack time?

Azusa:
There isn't any.

Azusa:
We'll grab something whenever a break comes up.

Tsumugi;
Azusa-chan is so dependable.

Ritsu:
I guess we can leave it all to Azusa this time.

Mio:
Uh-huh.

Azusa:
So did you finish the practice questions?

Yui:
Ahem, yes..

Azusa:
Okay then, let me go over your answers.

Yui:
[gasps] Uhh..

Azusa:
What's wrong, sempai?
Please take this seriously.

Yui:
I'm sorry.

Jun:
Your sister is certainly interesting really.

Ui:
Uh-huh! That's why everyday is fun with her.

Azusa:
The first question is, what sort of song do we wanna play?

Yui:
A lot of older folks come to the show.

Azusa:
Maybe an enka song?

Yui:
Um-hm!

Yui:
Fuwa fuwa time~!

Azusa:
Why are you singing it like that?

Yui:
How to sing voice modulation.

Azusa:
An enka Fuwa Fuwa Time?

Yui:
You try too, Azu-nyan.

Azusa:
Fuwa fuwa time~

Yui:
You're modulationg your whole body, not your voice.

Azusa:
Ugh. Fuwa fuwa time~~

Yui:
Whoa, you really don't have a feel for enka, do you?

Azusa:
Ugh, I'm sorry, enka is just not going to work.

Yui:
How about a folk song!?

Azusa:
A candle?

Yui:
You have to sing without blowing off the candle!

Azusa:
What kind of practicing is that!?

Yui:
All right, here goes!
Kokiriko no otake wa..

Azusa:
That's Kokiriko Bushi, right?

Yui:
Madono Sansa mo.. Sing it! The line is"Dededeko Den", Azu-nyan.
Hare no sansa mo..

Azusa:
Dededeko den.

Yui:
More energy! Madono sanasa mo..

Azusa:
Dededeko den!

Yui:
More!
Hare no sansa mo!

Azusa:
Dedede ko den!!

Yui:
That might just work!

Azusa:
I don't even know who I am anymore.

Granny:
Yui-chan.

Yui:
Ah, granny!

Granny:
I made you beef and potato croquettes.

Yui:
Whoa!! Thanks so much!

Granny:
I heard from Ui-chan that you were down here. Hard work practicing I see.

Yui:
I sure am. Ha! This is Azu-nyan, she's performing with me.

Azusa:
Pleased to meet you.

Granny:
Lovely to meet you, my dear. Don't push yourself too hard miss Azu-nyan.

Azusa:
Okay!

Yui:
Oh this is so good!

Azusa:
You know that neighbor of yours seems like a really nice lady.

Yui:
Yup, and her takikomi-rice and chirashi-zushi are totally delicious too!

Azusa:
You sound like a stray cat that see feeds.
So, we need to do our best on this.

Yui:
See what I mean? Now, what do you think we should call a little xxxx?

Azusa:
Right. We can't call ourselves After School Tea Time.

Yui:
How about "Sempai Kouhai"?

Azusa:
I don't think we really need to emphasise that.

Yui:
Well, how about just "Yui and Azu-nyan"?

Azusa:
How does "Yui-Azu" sound to you?

Yui:
Yeah! "Yui-Azu"!

Azusa:
Okay, let's decide on a song now.

Yui:
Oops you're right. Well what would be a good one?

Azusa:
I still think "Fuwa Fuwa Time" would go over well.

Yui:
Fuwa fuwa~~

Azusa:
UGH...

Ritsu:
What the heck is wrong, Sawa-chan?

Sawako:
I'm having big time tea and sweets withdraw. Why haven't we been having any tea and cakes party lately..??

Ritsu:
Because we have tests coming up.

Sawako:
So what ? What's more important to you people, that rule or me!?

Ritsu:
The rule, obviously.

Nodoka:
Ma'am? I dropped my eraser, may I please pick it up?

Teacher:
Go ahead.

Azusa:
She's sleeping now?

Announce:
Thanks, that's wonderful! Next up is no. 14, ..

Azusa:
Yui-sempai, Yui-sempai! It's time we're on!

Yui:
Ah!

Yui:
Hi everybody, I'm Yui Hirasawa, senior at Sakuragaoka High School!

Azusa:
And I'm Azusa Nakano,

Yui:
And together we are.. Yui!

Azusa:
Azu!

Yui:
Oh yeah!

Ritsu:
Yui's being her usual self!

Tsumugi:
Azusa-chan seems a little bit stiff.

Mio:
I think I'm more nervous than they are.

Yui:
I thought about singing Enka song first, and I even practiced my vocal undulation!

Azusa:
Don't you mean modulation!?

Mio:
Azusa as a straight man.

Ritsu:
They really pract for this.

Yui
I'm the older sempai around here, but Azunyan is totlally reprehensible one of our little team.

Azusa:
I hope you meant responsible.

Yui:
Oops, what we're gonna play?

Azusa:
Would you pull it together!

Yui:
Egh. Okay then, here is the Yui-Azu version of "Fude Pen Ball Pen"!
One, two, three,

Ritsu:
They're doing it like that?

Announce:
and that Yui-Azu, thank you girls! Next up is xxxx...

Yui:
I got a participation prize!

Granny:
You're giving it to me?

Yui:
Actually I had wanted to give you the first prize trip as a present.

Granny:
Oh, well it's the thought that counts. Thank you, Yui. I thought that two of you gave a wonderful performance. You've grown into a finer lady, really.

Yui:
Hehehe.

Granny:
That remainds me, I made plenty of chirashi-zushi, let's eat it Yui-chan and your friends.

Yui:
Oh yeah! Will you come Azu-nyan?

Azusa:
Sure!

Yui:
Are there shitake-mashrooms in it?

Granny:
Of course there are!

Yui:
Yeahhh!

Yui:
Ahhh!

Ritsu:
What's up?

Mio:
You got all high scores!

Ritsu:
How did you get that all?

Yui:
I must have guessed right.

Nodoka:
Yeah, I figured that was something like that.

Mio:
You did study really hard though, Yui.

Yui:
Wow, you think so?

Tsumugi:
You know, I wanted to play in that talent show, too.

Yui:
Oh, we can play as Yui-Mugi next time.

Ritsu:
How does RItsu-Mio sound?

Mio:
Or Yui-Mugi-Mio-Azu.

Ritsu:
Hey! No way! You and me MIo, YOU and ME! How about RIttan-and-Miotansounds?

Mio:
That's even worse.

Ritsu:
I got it! xxx!


Preview

Tsumugi:
Finnland this year is gonna be really fun.

Sawako:
Just what the heck are you here calling me like this!!

Azusa:
Could she really have a...?

Tsumugi:
But wait. Isn't she always complaining about how lonely she is because she is single?

MIo:
Look! I'm not interested in tha kind of stuff!
You could say that the Light Music Club is my boyfriend right now.

Yui:
Wow, Sawa-chan sure is popular.

Ritsu:
Yeah, but it kind of makes it harder to ask her.
Tsumugi:
Finland this year, is gonna be really fun.
Huh?

OP

Sawako:
The first thing in the morning is homeroom. Which means that I'm teaching back to back classes from the first to third period.
Over lunch break, I took a student home who had collapsed from anemia. And in fifth period, I patrolled the campus looking for students who were skipping class. After school I've been supervising the blass band club's practices because they have a competition soon.

Yui:
Whoa, that's why you're soaking your feet.

Sawako:
Yep.

Mio:
Who can blame you. You've been upon your feet all day.

Yui:
Have you tried ultra xxx's sandals?

Sawako:
No I can't! Even the freshmen think of me as an elegant lady-like teacher.

Yui:
Hmm.

Ritsu:
Have you ever thought about coming clean about your light music club past?
You know, you just say, "I'd be like this!"

Sawako:
Never give me that!!!
You just don't know what it's like, in education showing the slightest weakness could lead to catastrophe! If they ever learned of my past..

Oh no, you're interrupting? Please stop it?

Student:
You used to be exactly like this back when you are in high school, ain't that right?

Sawako:
That's what would happen!

Azusa:
I think you're probably blowing it out of proportion.

Sawako:
Excuse me for just a second?

Ritsu:
You're taking the call?

Sawako
Hello? Just what the heck are you thinking you're calling me here like this! Uh..
I'll be right back, okay?

Azusa:
Seems very fishy.

Ritsu:
Oh yes she was all, just what the heck are you thinking calling me like this!

Tsumugi:
Oh, that reminds me..

SIDE A

Mio:
That happened this morning?

Ritsu:
This morning she's dropped off at school and had some argument with the driver. And then she was surprised by a sudden phone call. The normal conclusion would be that the mystery caller is...

Tsumugi:
Ah!

Azusa:
No way!

Yui:
Her mother!?

Azusa:
You shouldn't worry about this Yui sempai.

Yui:
Why not!?

Azusa:
'Cause this isn't kids' stuff we're talking about.

Mio:
Oh, look. Speak of the devil.

Yui:
Huh? Sawa-chan spotted!

Ritsu:
Yeah. Take a look at that suspicious behaviour!

Mio:
This isn't the usual way that she goes on after school..?

Yui:
Oh, Mio-chan you sound like a detective!

Ritsu:
Come on! Let's follow her!

Azusa:
Ah, wait! Are you sure this is a good idea? If she spots us..

Tsumugi:
Look she's turned left! Come on, let's hurry!

Azusa:
Mugi sempai, isn't this more than anyone elese!?

Ritsu:
Okay, target acquired.
Yui, you ought to maintain watch focusing on the right.
Mugi, you exercise the utmost caution, so that Sawa-chan doesn't spot you.

Yui&Tsumugi:
Roger that!

Mio:
This is a stakeout?

Yui:
Oh right! You too, Mio-chan!

Mio:
You came ready!

Azusa:
Looks like something in the area spoke to her!

Mio:
You too!?

Yui:
You're right.

Azusa:
You think she really has..

Tsumugi:
But wait. Doesn't she always complain about how lonely she is because she's single?

Mio:
Maybe teachers have to keep certain parts of their life secret.

All:
Oh?

Yui:
Certain parts?

Mio:
[Gasps] N-no! Not me! I'm not hiding anything!

Ritsu:
You know, come to think of it, you are a hearty Mio. I wouldn't be surprised at all if boys liked you as much as or more than girls do.

Azussa:
Neither would I.

Mio:
How did we get on this topic!?

Yui
Mio-chan, congratulations.

Mio:
What are you doing, don't blow that joke!

Tsumugi:
Huh-hm.

Mio:
Don't stare at me!!
Look! I'm not interested in that kind of stuff! You could say that the light music club is my boyfriend right now.

All:
Oh.

Ritsu:
Aw! Why was I the only one.

Norimi:
Sorry I'm late.

All:
Oh?

Sawako:
Didn't I tell you never to call me during school there like you did?

Norimi:
I'm really sorry.

Sawako:
Yeah, well.

Yui:
Huh? Isn't that a girl?

Azusa:
Oh, darn.

Tsumugi:
It's a woman...

Ritsu:
Well, you don't need to read too much into it.

Mio:
Why did we follow them in here.

Yui:
It's like we're in a soap opera.

Ritsu:
Today is the day you get your comeuppance your scheming vixen!

Azusa:
They'll hear you!

Staff:
Pardon me.

All:
Y-yes!?

Staff:
Party of five, ladies?

All:
We are! Okay!

Ritsu:
Mind if we sit over here?

Yui:
Aw, we're still in our school uniforms!

Mio:
Mugi! Keep your head down!

Tsumugi:
Oh. All right!

Yui:
Come on Azu-nyan, scoot over.

Azusa:
Why don't you sit on the other side, huh!?

Yui:
You're so mean! Ah!

Norimi:
Uh?

Sawako:
What's the matter?

Norimi:
Ahm, it's nothing really.

Yui:
That was close.

Ritsu:
Yui, stay down there.

Yui:
Huh!?

Ritsu:
I'll give you this.

Yui:
I don't wanna.

Ritsu:
Hey, whatch it! Don't just butt your way in like that. You're squashing me!

Azusa:
Will the both of you please be quiet!

Sawako:
You mean they're holding the party there?

Norimi:
That's right.

Yui:
Oh hey, isn't that..?

Waiter:
Excuse me girls, may I take your order?

Ritsu:
Ah, five black tea, please?

Waiter:
We have a lovely self-sevice area over there.

Ritsu:
Not good.

Norimi:
Com'on, don't be like that.

Ritsu:
Hm, I'll have this chocolate cake then.

Yui:
Hey, don't just order for yourself!

Ritsu:
We need something!

Azusa;
In that case, I'm gonna have the pumpkin custard a la mode.

Yui:
Huh! They serve amazing thing like that here!?

Tsumugi:
I think I'll have the cream anmitsu.

Yui:
Hah! That's what I wanted!

Mio:
You CAN other the same thing, you know.

Yui:
That'll be a waste. We have some much good stuff here.

Yui:
Ah, ahem... I guess I'll have this.. ahem, I guess I will have...!! This. This please.

Azusa:
You completely lost sight of our initial objective.

Ritsu:
We're paying separately and not dutch, you got that?

Yui:
What!? We are!?

Ritsu:
Obviously.

Yui:
Well then, in that case..

Azusa:
Will you please make up your mind? We're gonna be spotted.

All:
Ah!

Sawako:
You've been acting strange since we got here.

Norimi:
Uh-m. It's nothing.

Sawako:
Liar. you keep looking behind me.

Ritsu:
SHhh! Shhhh!

Norimi:
Please. Think about it one more time, alright?

Sawako:
Talk about pushy!

Yui:
Huh, It cost me 14.80 with tax! They're good my allowance.

Azusa:
you didn't actually need to buy it, you know.

Yui:
I didn't wanna miss out all that good stuff!

Mio:
You know we never did figure out who the woman with Sawa-chan was.

Tsumugi:
That's true.

Yui:
I recongnise her.

Mio:
Yui, you know her?

Yui:
Yes, of course! She was with Sawa-chan in all those old pictures we found, remember?

Mio:
Pictures.. Ah! She's Death Devil's..

Norimi:
Name is Christina!!

Mio:
[Screams]

Norimi:
Sorry, was I a bit overboard

Ritsu:
Oh, no. She's always been like this.

Norimi:
Really. Let me guess. You're the Light music club, aren't you?

Yui:
Oh, are you another master detective?

Azusa:
We're wearing our uniforms are carrying guitars, it's not a huge stretch.

Norimi:
I need to talk to you about something as a light music club's alumnus. Who's the president?

Norimi:
Ehh! ..Mio is.

Azusa:
Don't abandon your post.

Norimi:
Wow, this is one a hell of you axe, you've got here.

Yui:
Oh, thanks.

Norimi:
This really takes me back.

Mio:
She is.. good.

Azusa:
Maybe even better than Ms. Yamanaka.

Norimi:
Really? Thanks a lot. Sawako and I used to have technique competitions every day.

Yui:
Oh wow, you did? Really?

Norimi:
Oh don't be shy. Go ahead and order something.

Norimi:
Parhaps another around of juices for the girls.

Master:
Sure thing, Nori-chan.

Yui:
Nori-chan?

Norimi:
Sorry about that, my name is Norimi.

Yui:
Oh my goodness, you mean you're not a foreigner of some kind?

Ritsu:
Of course she isn't.

Yui:
But, her name.

Norimi:
I'm sorry, I should have introduced myself sooner. By the way, if there's anything that you girls like to eat, just say the word, okay?

Yui&Ritsu:
She seems really nice!

Tsumugi:
Then I would like the ganmodoki, please.

Master:
One ganmo, coming up!

Azusa:
Oh, do you like those?

Tsumugi:
I don't know, I've never tried that before. Its name makes it sound just amazing. Ganmodoki.

Azusa:
You really think so?

Mio:
So, what did you wanna talk to us about?

Norimi:
Ah.. well, it's nothing major or anything like that.
The thing is, Sawako is said to get married.

All:
EhhhHHH!?

Norimi:
Don't worry, that was just a joke.

All:
[Sigh]

Ritsu:
You call that a joke!?

Norimi:
An old classmate of ours from the light music club is getting married. And she said that she wants old band to play on the reception. But Sawako is the only one who is not board with it.

Ritsu:
Yeah. she treats her light music club's past as a dark secret.

Mio:
Yeah.

Master:
One ganmodoki.

Tsumugi:
It's more mundane than I expected.

Azusa:
Well what did you have pictured in your head!?

Tsumugi:
Something.. spiny I guess.

Azusa:
Spiny..?

Yui:
She seems.. so cool.

Norimi:
Ah, I'm sorry. Didn't mean to keep it so long. Here.

Yui:
Ah, okay. Hmm..

Norimi:
Sorry, did I mess something up?

Yui:
Um-m! No, everything's fine!

Sawako:
English class today will be an independent study. Work quietly.

Classmate:
Ms.Akiyama. It's from Ms.Kotobuki.

Mio:
Thank you.

Tsumugi:
Mio-chan. Have you thought of anything?

Mio:
I've been thinking about it a lot. But if the old club members couldn't convince her, I don't see how are we gonna be able to do it. Thanks.

Classmate:
Here.

Tsumugi:
Thanks a lot. Hmm. Apparently other teachers and the members of the newspaper club are coming to the reception.

Mio:
Maybe we could disguise her with the makeup or something.

Tsumugi:
But considering the outcome if she's found out, perhaps she shouldn't.

Mio:
Good point. What do you think, Yui?

Yui:
Mio-chan, you're handwriting is so cute.

Mio:
How about you, Ritsu. You're our president.
Be serious!

Sawako:
Ms. Akiyama. Did you draw this picture?

Mio:
Hah! No! Ah! You traitor!

Ritsu:
I am a pen.

Tsumugi:
It's me!

Sawako:
Ms.Kotobuki?

Mio:
Mugi..?

Tsumugi:
I was the one who sent the first note and started all this. So Mio-chan isn't the one to blame for any of it!

Sawako:
Oh, but still, she had..

Tsumugi:
But hallway! May I stand out there as a punishment!?

Sawako:
Ah? That's.. really not..

Tsumugi:
I wanna stand outside!

So this is what it's like to stand out here. Twelve years after starting my school carrier, my dream is finally come true. I can graduate with no unfinished business.

Ritsu:
What kind of dream do you have?

Yui:
I did it ! Ritchan look! I reached it !

Ritsu:
Yui seems to be having a ground all time.

Mio:
To get back to the topic, what do you think you should do?

Yui&Ritsu:
Huh?

Mio:
Don't you people remember what Norimi told us about Sawa-chan last night?

Ritsu:
Of course.

Yui:
I forget. What did she say?

Ritsu:
Get with it, Yui.

Norimi:
Fine. I'll let you guys talk Sawako in the plan.

Ritsu:
You know, Sawa-chan can be really stubborn sometimes.

Norimi:
So what? You're throwing in a towel already? Well, if you guys can't talk her into it then..

Mio:
What will you do?

Norimi:
Let's just say I'll have some special training for you!

All:
Ehhh!

Yui:
Wait, that happened!?

Ritsu:
You don't remember?

Tsumugi:
I wonder what special training means.

Mio:
Well it's probably when alumnus says something like that it tends to be kind of harsh practice.

Tsumugi:
It's true, but we aren't an athletic club.

Ritsu:
No, but with the light music club, it might be...

Norimi:
All right girls. You're gonna play until I can hear the music.

Yui:
But we don't have any of our..

Norimi:
They say music comes from our soul, don't they? Put your hearts into it and you should be able to play music without instruments. Get started!

All:
Y-Yes ma'am!

Norimi:
I'm not hearing anything!!!

All:
We're so sorry!

Ritsu:
...Like that.

Yui&Tsumugi:
Seriously!?

Mio:
Come on, don't joke around about that.

Yui:
Oh my.

Tsumugi:
It was a joke?

Ritsu:
Fine. Let's all talk to her right after the school is finished.

Sawako
You're gonna stand there all day? Get back to your independent study, alright?

All:
Okay.

Ritsu:
Pardon us. Is Ms.Yamanaka here..

Students:
Thank you Ms.Yamanaka!

Sawako:
We don't wanna bother the other teachers so let's keep it down, okay?

Yui:
Wow. Sawa-chan sure is popular, huh?

Ritsu:
Yeah, but it kinda makes it harder to ask her.

Norimi:
I see.

Mio:
We're sorry.

Norimi:
So Sawako is just as popular now.

Mio:
Yes.

Ritsu:
So, what's this special training you mentioned?

Norimi:
Oh, that. I was just kidding. No I wasn't. I just want your help with something.

Yui:
Umm. This is really hard.

Ui:
Hey, big sis. You still haven't taken your bath yet?

Yui:
No. I'll take it in a little while.

Ui:
But you'll oversleep again.

Yui:
You know, Ui? Adults are pretty amazing, aren't they?

Ui:
I guess. Why do you ask?

Yui:
When I'm grown up and I'm an adult, will I be mature too?

Ui:
Big sis, do you want some juice?

Yui:
Today I shall have tea!

Ui:
Coming right up.

Sawako:
Congratulations.

Bride:
Oh, Sawako.

Friend:
Good to see you again.

Sawako:
I'm so sorry that I can't play for you. Now that I'm a teacher I have to be careful what I do.

Bride:
It's alright. We can't wait for the show.

Yui:
Guitaaa!

Mio:
Quit crying! It ony makes you look more scarier!

Tsumugi:
Acturally, I rather like it on you.

Azusa:
You overdid it Mugi-sempai.

Norimi:
Oh, and Ms.president, I want YOU to use this to breath fire, okay?

Ritsu:
Ehh, oh, thanks, but ehhh... No waaayyy!!!

Annouce:
And now, ladies and gentlemen, it's time for a special performance by Death Devil. A band composed of the bride's highschool friends. Today the performance features a special line up.

Sawako:
Huh? Hey, what are those girls think they're... Yui-chan, what did you do to your guitar?? What are you doing with them?

Norimi:
Buckle up you basterds, tonight we'll go rock!!

All:
Yeah!!

Yui:
Ah! I miss the note.

Azusa:
Yui-sempai, what are you doing!

Yui:
I'm sorry, let's take it again from the top!

Attendance A:
With the name like Death Devil, I was worried what kind of band they would be, but they're awfully cute.

Sawako:
Cute!?

Attendance B:
You can do it, Death Devil!

Attendance C:
We're all rooting for you!

Sawako:
Rooting for them?

This is all wrong. This isn't what Death Devil is about. There has to be a brutal crush in their souls. That's Death Devil is at their best. No, I mustn't, I'm a teacher now. I left that part of me long ago in the past. And It will be an insult to this people who're trying so hard.

Yui:
Gosh I'm so sorry..

Sawako:
This is wrong. Death Devil is.. The Death Devil I'd pursued all these years is.. Death Devil, MY DEATH DEVIL IS!!!

Yui:
Huh? What happened? Where is the lights?

Groom:
No come back.

Bride:
I know. Huh?

Yui:
Sawa-chan!

Bride:
It's Sawako.

Bride's friend:
Here it comes.

Sawako:
Death Devil ain't this half-assed waterly crap these cheapies we're trying to play. So I'm gonna show you the best until you die!!

Norimi:
Okay!! Let's do it!!!

Drummer:
One, two!

Sawako:
Ah, what have I done!!!

All:
Nobody made her do!

Sawako:
I'm finished. The gentle-like image I worked so hard to cultivate.

All:
We're truly ashamed of ourselves.

Sawako:
It's okay, in the end it wasn't..

Ritsu:
Yeah you're right. It's your own fault for snapping like yo..

Sawako
I said already it was my fault, didn't I ?

Ritsu:
I-I'm sorry!

Tsumgi:
Come in!

Student A:
Ahem.. Ms.Yamanaka? Is that you?

Sawako:
Huh?

Student A&B:
Thank you so much!

Student C:
I can't believe it, you're so awesome in the show last night!

Student B:
We can't wait until the next time!

Sawako:
I don't get it.

Yui:
It looks like Sawa-chan is popular no matter what she does.

Ritsu:
I'm thinking that maybe a band has to be way over the top so anyone's going to remember them.

Tsumugi:
Maybe.

Ritsu:
Okay let's do it! Start from makeup on Mio!

Mio:
Don't even think about it!

Tsumugi:
I'd rather like the whole idea of it.

Azusa:
You really go overboard with that stuff!

Yui:
that's.. [indistinctive]
Drumming's gonna kill me!

Azusa:
It's another scorcher today.

Mio:
Huh? Where did Yui run off to?

Yui:
[Groans] It's so hot..

OP

Yui:
I wish summer was just gone away already. Ugh..

Ritsu:
Oh, please. You'll be saying the exact opposite once winter is here.

Yui:
Nooo.

Azusa:
Here's some water, sempai.

Yui:
Whoa! Thank you Azunyan, thank you, Azunya.. ugh.. My face is hot.

Mio:
Then don't do that.

Side A

Mio:
I have to say, it's like an oven in here. Long hair makes my neck sweat like crazy.

Ritsu:
Oh! Why don't you just put your hair up then?
Okay, all done.

Tsumugi:
Aha! You look just like Azusa-chan!

Ritsu:
Yeah! It looks terrible.. [groans]

Mio:
You're the one who did it!

Ritsu:
Sorry..!

Ritsu:
What's going on!?

Mio:
Oh Tonchan.

Ritsu:
He get a sunburn?

Mio:
NO off course he didn't.

Tsumugi:
Tonchan's molted.

All:
Molted?

Yui:
Molted? I didn't know turtles did that!

Tsumugi:
Of course they do, they're reptiles. The turtles that we have in home are all molted, too.

Azusa:
Ah. Thank goodness. I was so worried that Tonchan might be getting sick.

Yui:
I got it! We should all shed too just like turtles do.

Ritsu:
You do know that humans can't shed their skin, right?

Yui:
Ho ho, but we can, Ritsu!
Yosakoi!

Ritsu:
Is that what you meant?

Yui:
Whoa. this is kinda comfy. It might be easier to play this way.

Ritsu:
Not happening.

Yui:
Hmm. Why don't you put yours on too, Mio-chan?

Mio:
No-no-no-no! No one but you would ever wear something like that to.. Eh!?

Yui:
Mugi-chan!

Mio:
Seriously?

Yui:
Hmm. I wonder if it's cold on top of the desks?

Ritsu:
You're doing what I think?

Yui:
Here goes.

Ritsu:
Oh, how does it feel?

Yui:
It wasn't as cold as I hoped it would be.

Tsumugi:
Uh-huh.

Azusa:
[Sighs] It's not cold, either.

Mio:
For some reason, today seems especially hot.

Azusa:
Still, with all the sweating we're doing we're sure to lose some weight.

Tsumugi:
Summer suits time!

Mio:
This will do the trick, right!?

Yui:
No way!

Ritsu:
Those again?

Mio:
I'm sweating all right!

Tsumugi:
But I can't play properly.

Ritsu:
Hey, let's play a word association game.

All:
Huh?

Ritsu:
What says summer in Japan with anything else?

Yui:
Watermelons!

Tsumugi:
Big wind chimes?

Ritsu:
[Clicks tongue]

Yui:
Ah, Ice cream!

Azusa:
I know it's fireworks!

Ritsu:
No no no no.

Yui:
Oh, chilled Chinese noodles?

Ritsu:
You're not even close. Wow, it's all about food with you, isn't it?

Yui:
Huh? What can it be then?

Ritsu:
The answer is.. Scary ghost story!
S-Sorry.

Ritsu:
This is the story that is told in this school. Apparently, a student came here alone one night to retrieve something she had forgotten. The school should have been deserted. And yet, the note of the piano being played could be heard emanating from the music room.

Mio:
[screams] Mugi!

Ritsu:
She thought this was unusual, so she peeked into the music room and what did she see... ?
Sawa-chan, tutoring a student who was applying to a music's con!!

Ritsu:
Agh. Isn't there anything else we can do to cool off?

Azusa:
You know it's bad for your heart to get yourself so agitated.

Ritsu:
Men, It seems like the hotter we fan ourselves.

Yui:
The hotter it feels whenever we stop.

Tsumugi:
Thinking about how hot it is only makes you feel even hotter than you really are.

Azusa:
Oh you mean a mind over matter?

Yui:
Okay Ritchan, let's think about lots of cool things!

Ritsu:
Things that are cool, huh.

Yui:
So cold!
It sure is nice and cool.

Ritsu:
It sure is, Yui.

Yui:
It's all about mind over matter.

Ritsu:
You know, you're maybe right.

Yui:
It's hot..

Ritsu:
Don't give in, Yui. Think about how cool it is!

Yui:
It's so cool, It's so cool, It's so cool, It's so cool..

Ritsu:
It's so cool! ...

Azusa:
Yui sempai, are you feeling okay!?

Yui:
This is so hard..

Ritsu:
I can't tell my mind it's cool when the matter is so hot..

Mio:
Hey. Back at the beginning of the school year when we were all cleaning in here, I could swear that I put a fan in the storage room.

Ritsu:
That's it!

Yui:
Mio-chan, you're genius!

Mio:
Found it!

Ritsu:
It's ancient.

Mio:
Well, I guess I know how she feels.
This way the breeze should hit everyone, okay?

All:
Whoa.

Mio:
Here goes.

Ritsu:
Well, excuse me! I'm not getting any winds at all back here!

Mio:
You're way in the back, what did you expect?

Ritsu:
[Groans]

Mio:
Hey, Ritsu?

Ritsu:
Alright then, ultra maximum power, go!
[Screams]

Yui:
I think you broke.

Ritsu:
Nothing we can do.

Tsumugi:
Hey guys, I brought ice cubes today, see?

Yui:
Whoa.

Ritsu:
It's cold.

Mio:
Let me see!
Mugi, when did you get these..
It's freezing! What do you think you're doing!?

Ritsu:
Now now. How could I pass that up?

Tsumugi:
But the truth is, I'd planned to use this to make us some shaved ice.

Yui&Azusa:
I love!

Tsumugi:
But I forgot to bring shaved ice machine from home.

Yui&Azusa:
MMmm.

Yui:
Whoa, it's all nice and chilly.

Ritsu:
Really!? Me too, me too! You weren't kidding that's freezing..

Yui:
You know, it's kind of lukewarm now.

Ritsu:
Ice sure melts quickly when it's hot.

Yui:
Ritchan, go buy us some more ice.

Ritsu:
Why don't YOU go buy some.

Yui:
Don't wanna it's too hot.

Ritsu:
It's hot for me, too.

Yui:
Just go get it, Ritchan.

Ritsu:
Oh, no! My chronic back pain returned.

Yui:
That's not fair. I was here with my feet in the bucket first.

Ritsu:
And my feet have been in the bucket for a lot less time than yours have been.

Yui:
Ritchan, you're the one who should go!

Ritsu:
No, you should go!

Mio:
Would you too give it a rest? For Pete's sake.

Ritsu:
Seems like a big waste to throw away all this ice.

Yui:
Ha! Why don't we gather it up and put it in Tonchan's tank!

Azusa:
No you can't! The tank has its own thermo stuff, so he's fine just the way he is!

Yui:
Oh Azunyan, I was kidding.

Azusa:
Well you know your jokes never really sound much like jokes, Yui-sempai.
Oh, it says here turtles grow in a pace of the size of its tank! So we want Tonchan to get bigger, we have to get him a bigger tank!

Mio:
So then, the reason Tonchan were shedding,

Yui:
It's because he wants to grow big and strong!

Tsumugi:
In that case, we have a larger tank in my house that hasn't been used!

Azusa:
Really you do!? But how in the world would we get it over here?

Mio:
Didn't Sawachan say that once she has a car?

Azusa:
You're right she did! Let's go and ask her if she'll help us.

Yui:
Sawachan hasn't hang at our club, hasn't she?

Ritsu:
Good thing, if she was here, it would just make the room hotter. Or I know, maybe she's passed out from the heat around here somewhere!

Mio:
Like the two of you have any right to laugh at that.

Sawako:
What's the matter, girls? What brings you two here to the staff room? What? Oh where are you two taking me??
It's so hooot...

Azusa:
Ms. Yamanaka, look at Ton-chan!

Sawako:
What, if he is in the water, it's nice and comfy.. Ah, looks like he's molting.

Mio:
That why we wanna switch him into a larger tank that Mugi has at her house.

Azusa:
Would you mind helping us out bringing it over here in your car?

Sawako:
Ugh, it's way too much work!

Tsumugi:
Look Sawa-chan, I have an ice cream float for you.

Sawako:
I'll fetch my car once!

Ritsu:
She's so easy to manipulate.


Sawako:
Thanks for waiting.

Ritsu:
Bye, it's my job as club president to go.

Yui:
Whaat!? Not fair! You can't go by yourself! I wanna go too! I wanna ride in Sawachan's car!
Hey! No touching!

Azusa:
Huh? I can't go?

Mio:
They're going to Mugi's house, so Mugi has to go. No matter what!

Ritsu:
Hmmm.

Yui:
You're lucky Mugi-chan. So, Mugi-chan gets shotgun, and me and Azunyan, Ritchan and Mio-chan will all ride in the back seat, how about that?

Sawako:
My car only seats four, so that only leaves three seats free!

Yui:
In that case, do you wanna take Sawachan's spot, Ritchan?

Ritsu:
Okay.

Sawako:
Well, who's gonna drive tha car!?

Yui:
I hate say it, but you really should've bought a bigger car, Sawa-chan.

Sawako:
I didn't buy the car for you, so if you don't mind, you can spare me the commentary?

Tsumugi:
Ah! You know the fish tanks are rather large and bulky, so there is a really good chance to take up the entire inside of the car.

Mio:
Well then, assuming that the tank will take up the rear of the car, Mugi's the only one who can go.

Yui&Ritsu:
Say what!?

Tsumugi:
We'll be back soon, everyone!

Yui:
Have a safe trip...

Ritsu:
Ah, it's hot.

Tsumugi:
Whoa. I'm riding in my teacher's car!
Oh, what's that on your mirror?

Sawako:
It's a good luck charm.

Tsumugi:
You can see everything from the front seat. Whoa, the seat moves! Ahh!

Sawako:
I knew that was coming.


Tsumugi:
We're back!

Ritsu:
Look at that!

Yui:
It's huge!

Mio:
That's amazing!

Sawako:
Incredible.

Yui:
What do you mean, incredible?

Sawako:
It was just incredible. I'll be sure to make home visit more often, alright?

Tsumugi:
Thank you for looking out for me.

Ritsu:
Oh, thanks for doing this for us.

All:
Thank you very much.

Sawako:
You're welcome, girls.

Yui:
Thanks for waiting Ton-chan.

Azusa:
Look, here is a big new tank for you.

Yui:
isn't that terrific, Ton-chan?
Ah, the sunlight is hitting the one corner of the tank!

Azusa:
Yeah, you're right. We'd better cover it up with something.

Ritsu:
Don't we have some packing tape?

Yui:
I think they're somewhere in the store room.
You think that'll work?

Ritsu:
It should be just fine.

Sawako:
Okay then, I think it's time I headed back to the staff room.

Ritsu:
Wait! Don't go yet!

Sawako:
You need something else?

Ritsu:
Oh, please stay, you're the only one we can turn to!

Sawako:
Right. I'm going now.

Ritsu:
Sawa-chan!

Sawako:
I said, no!

Ritsu:
Mugi!

Tsumugi:
Sawa-chan! Would you like a nice chocolate frappe?

Sawako:
Yes please!

Sawako:
Hm.
An air conditioner, huh?

Ritsu:
Can you do anything for us?

Sawko:
I don't know.

Mio:
Oh, really?

Ritsu:
Right! In that case, we'll buy the air conditioner ourselves.

Mio:
Where are we supposed to get that much money?

Ritsu;
We'll get ourselves some jobs!

All:
Yeah!!

Azusa:
Don't you guys need to study for your college entrance exams?

Sawako:
Oh wait a minute, why don't you go and ask the student council?

Ritsu:
Good idea!

Mio:
You think they are really okay to request? Air conditioners aren't cheap.

Ritsu:
Yeah, maybe this'll cost a little bribe.

Yui:
You know Nodokachan was saying earlier that she wished she a had computer.

Ritsu:
Mugi, xxx up computer right away!

Tsumugi:
Right, you got it!

Mio:
That would cost as much as an air conditioner..

Ritsu:
We've got an emergency, Yui's passed out from the heat!

Yui:
Ritchan, just once before I die, I wanted to stop by finger sand.

Ritsu:
Yui! YUI!!

Ritsu:
Here's your wish for air conditioner of gold, or an air conditioner made of silver?

Yui:
Mighty god, my only wish is but for an ordinary air conditioner.

Ritsu:
How honest, this creature is. So I shall grant a brand new air conditioner !

Yui:
Oh, praise god!

Nodoka:
What' with all the cheap theatrics?

Mio:
Sorry for all the ruckus.

Nodoka:
[chuckles] So, what is it that you want?

Yui:
The thing is, we came here to ask a favor for student council.

Ritsu:
Wait,Yui. Feel the air. It's cool here.
This room has an air conditioner! Abuse of authority!

Yui:
Nodoka-chan, I believed in you.

Nodoka:
What are you talking about. We talked about this at the culb president council. The school has decided to OK air conditioners in the club rooms. So I said that any clubs that wanted one should put in the request.

Mio:
President?

Ritsu:
I forgot to attend..Aw! Sorry..

Mio:
I-Is it too late to apply!?

Nodoka:
Ah, well am..

Ritsu:
We're back.

Tsumugi:
How did it go?

Ritsu:
I'm going put in a formal proposal at tomorrow's club president council.

Azusa:
Council? I've never heard of that. What will you guys talk about there?

Ritsu:
I don't know! I've never been to one.

Mio:
I wouldn't be boasting.

Tsumugi:
Well does the council vote to turn down requests made by the clubs?

Mio:
I suppose so.

Yui:
[cries] But I really wanted an air conditioner.

Mio:
we'll just have to plead our case convincingly.

All:
Hmmm.

Mio:
Well for now, why don't we rehearse our petition for the council?

Ritsu:
What do you mean, rehearse?

Mio:
Well think of reasons they might turn down the request, and prepare counter arguments.

Ritsu:
Yeah, I follow you, good idea!

Mio:
Very well, those with business before the council, raise your hand.

Ritsu:
Hrere! the light music club request the air conditioner!

Mio:
Thsoe in agreement with Ms, Tainaka's request, say agreed,

All:
Agreed!

Mio:
Ugh, If you all agreed, it defeats the purpose!
Ahem,. Right, those opposed to the request?

Tsumugi:
President! We heard petitions for air conditioner at the previous council, so I believe it's far to late to request one now.

Ritsu:
Uh, that was because..

Azusa:
Ma'am! Light music club doesn't seem to practice all that often, so do they really need an air conditioner in their room?

Ritsu:
I'm so sorry I wasted your time! I withdraw my request!

Mio:
Why the heck you're giving up!?

Ritsu:
Because, this is hard..

Tsumugi:
You have to make some kind of counter argument.

Yui:
It'll be okay Ritchan you can do it I know it! You're the club president, you're a big sister and you're a good drummer!

Ritsu:
Hey, you're right, Yui! Bring it on, Azusa!

Azusa:
One more time, then!
I don't believe the light music club meets an air conditioner because they never practice!

Ritsu:
We do too practice all the time! But it's a secret practice..

Mio:
Why do you have to say that our practices are secret?

Yui:
Ma'am! I believe that there's more to being cold than practice!

Ritsu:
Wow, Yui's saying something amazingly sensible ones!

Yui:
We deepen our bonds of friendship, and we interact with students of other class years!

Ritsu:
That's right, that's right!

Yui:
We also eat cake and drink tea and go to the beach!

Azusa:
See? The light music club has no need for air conditioner in their room!

Yui:
If we had an air conditioner, we would practice!

Azusa:
Would you, really?

Yui:
We sweat like crazy when we play our instruments out loud.

Ritsu:
Drums are phisically demanding which makes it very dangerous to play in the summer heat!

Azusa:
Ah, nevertheless...

Ritsu:
Plus, if we had the air conditioner, our performance would be a lot cooler!

Yui:
Yeah! They would!

Azusa:
Umm, you made your case.

Ritsu:
Oh yeah, now I'm ready for the real thing!

Yui:
Go get it, Ritchan!

Ritsu:
Watch what a club president can do if she set her mind to it!

Yui:
Ahahha!

Nodoka:
So is there any other business today?

Ritsu:
Ma'am!

Nodoka:
Ms. Tainaka?

Ritsu:
The light music club requests an air conditioner.

Nodoka:
Are there any objection to the proposal?

Ritsu:
Huh, wait, so you are okay with it?

Student coucil A:
But madam president, the student council's budget for the year has already broadly allocated.

Nodoka:
Well, we could hold off on replacing the copier, at least until next year, right?

Student coucil A:
Yes we could! That would do it!

Ritsu:
Huh.. That's it? Seriously?

All:
Whoa!!

Yui:
We're in heaven!

Tsumugi:
So cool!

Mio:
Now we can finally practice without sweating like mad.. huh?

Ritsu:
I'd say we all call it a day and relax.

Mio:
Hey!

Ritsu:
I'm just kidding!

Mio:
Oh good grief.

Ritsu:
Here we go! One, two, three, .. Huh?

Mio:
What's the matter, Yui?

Yui:
I eh.. forgot that air conditioning makes me queasy.

Mio:
What are we supposed to do, then!?

Yui:
I feel terrible..

Ritsu:
We can't win.
Sawako:
Summer vacation is starting, so try to spend it in a productive manner. Now, as seniors, you'll have summer session classes, so you should..

Yui:
Summer vacation.
Let's have another training camp!

Ritsu:
Huh?

Yui:
Another training camp!

Tsumugi:
Oh yes, let's!

Ritsu:
Good idea!

Mio:
Wait! We have entrance exams to..

Yui:
Now all those in favour say aye!

All but Mio:
Aye!

Mio:
Hey, if we're voting we're gonna have to ask Azusa if she agrees..

Yui:
I already texted to Azunyan and I asked her to vote on it.

Ritsu:
That makes it four to one. Right then! We're having a training camp again this year!

All but Mio:
Yeah!

Mio:
Y-yeah..

OP

Ui:
Come on in, everybody.

All:
Thanks for having us over.

Ui:
Hey, big sis! Everybody's here now!

Yui:
Hey guys, come on in, come on in.

Ritsu:
Aha! Lazing around the house?

Yui:
Come sit! Let's play video games!

Ritsu:
Whoa!

Tsumugi:
Yes, let's!
I didn't know you can..

Azusa:
Remind me what we came here for again.

Mio:
It's supposed to be a meeting about the camp.
Come on, let's get down to business.

Yui:
[Moans] We can play for a while.

Ritsu:
Yeah.

Azusa:
Am.. Are you sure that training camp is a good idea?

Yui:
Why wouldn't it be?

Azusa:
Well, for one thing, you're all seniors.

Ritsu:
Yeah, but we could use a break, you know?

Yui:
Yeah, that's right.

Azusa:
Are you sure it's going to be just a little?

Ritsu:
You know we went to the beach the last two years so how about the mountains this time?

Yui:
Huh? I wanna go to the beach again!

Ritsu:
We will be able to catch fish and have a BBQ!

Yui:
Oh. That sounds pretty tasty.

Ritsu:
Right?

Azusa:
I knew it, you guys just wanna goof off.

Mio:
By the way, where would you rather go, Azusa?

Azusa:
Well, Natsu-Fest takes place in the mountains!

MIo:
Really?

Yui:
Miso-Paste?

Tsumugi:
Nori-Paste?

Azusa:
No no, Not those things, Natsu-Fest!


Ritsu:
Natsu-Fest is a huge outdoor festival where lots of different bands play. Tens of thousands of people go every year.

Mio:
I've always wanted to check out Natsu-Fest at least once!

Azusa:
Yeah, me too! Fests will be a real learning experience to watch professional bands at work!

Ritsu:
So, we all agreed?

Yui:
Natsu-Fest is the mountain?

Azusa:
The venue is IN the mountains.

Yui:
Inside the mountain...
We're not gonna get in alive at there, are we?

Mio:
I really don't know what you're thinking, but whatever it is, it's wrong.

Ritsu:
What are we gonna do about getting tickets though? Is it too late to buy any?

Sawako:
What would you do without me, no more rescuing you..

All:
Ohh!?

Azusa:
That's amazing!

Ritsu:
That's our Sawa-chan! Wait, when did YOU get here!?

Sawako:
Could I get a cup of barley tea, too?

Ui:
O-of course!


Mio:
Well, my first Natsu-Fest..

Azusa:
Yeah, I've never seen an outdoor show before either!

Mio:
I bet it feels really great!

Sawako:
Keep that carefree attitude and you're looking at defeat.

Mio:
Defeat by what!?

Sawako:
By summer! Pay attention! The glare of the blazing sun, the sweltering heat, and the summer insects are even now awaiting to eat you alive! Those who choose to battle in Natsu-Fests must face all of these challenges, prepare yourself!

Mio:
Yes ma'am!

Azusa:
Oh! Mio-sempai is all just-up!

Azusa:
Looks like nobody's here yet.

Tsumugi:
Azusa-chan!

Azusa:
Ah, good morning Mugi-sempai!

Tsumugi:
Good morning! Oh, are you the only one here?

Azusa:
Yes!

Ritsu:
Morning! Hey!

Mio:
Figures you two are the only ones who manage to make it on time.

Azusa:
You look like you didn't get much sleep last night, Mio-sempai?

Ritsu:
No, she was up all night working out which band she wants to see.

Mio:
It's packed with bands I don't wanna miss!

Azusa:
Yeah, looks like they have a whole bunch of stages there.

Tsumugi:
Oh look, the bus is here.

Azusa:
I'd better try calling Yui-sempai.

Yui:
I'm right over here you guys! Hi, good morning!

Ritsu:
Yui!

Azusa:
You should have said you were already here!

Yui:
Well, I was waiting to see when you'll notice me.

Azusa:
I'm sorry, but it never occurred to me that you might be the first one to get here.

Mio:
Of course we're still missing one person from our group.　

Sawako:
Girls....

Yui:
Sawa-chan, what's the matter with you!?

Sawako:
I went out to a show last night and drunk until the morning.. I came straight here from the club.

Ritsu:
Sawa-chan, that was stupid. Why would you do something like that if you knew we were leaving today?

Mio:
Come on, let's hit the road!


Yui:
Ugh, feel sick.

Sawako:
Oh yeah, welcome to my life.

Yui:
You're sick because you're hungover aren't you?

Sawako:
Yeah, I live the rock-and-roll lifestyle.

Yui:
I really don't know what that means.

Tsumugi:
You too alright?

Azusa:
Yui-sempai gets carsick easily huh.

Mio:
I'm going to see this band and this band, period!

Ritsu:
You can't, Mio. They're playing on different stages at the same time!

Mio:
Then I want two bodies!

Ritsu:
Ughh. Choose one or the other. Or only listen to half of each one.

Mio:
I wanna teleport!

Ritsu:
Get real.

Azusa:
Mio-sempai is acting like a baby.

Tsumugi:
Ah! I want yakisoba, yakisoba! Yakisoba is the one thing I intend to eat there!

Azusa:
Mugi-sempai is acting childish too!

Ritsu:
You guys are...

Sawako:
I wanna die..

Mio:
I can't believe I'm gonna be able to listen to music from sunup to sundown!

Ritsu:
You know, she's been getting more and more wound up.

Yui:
Can you really blame her?

Ritsu:
Huh? You got icecream!

Yui:
It's got lots of great things to eat and they sell lots of souvenirs too!
Rest stops are so awesome, they have everything!

Azusa:
I thought you were feeling carsick and yucky.

Yui:
I'm all better now! Have a taste of this, Azu-nyan. Soft-serve made from the highland dairy!

Azusa:
If you're offering...

Tsumugi:
Our rest stop is nearly over.

Yui:
Huh!? But I haven't bought any souvenirs yet!

Azusa:
This isn't our destination Yui-sempai.

Tsumugi:
Indeed it isn't. This is no place for one to eat Yakisoba!

Azusaka:
Mugi-sempai is slightly off-kilter too.

Yui:
Are we there yet!?

Sawako:
Yui-chan, please, stay down in your seat.

Mio:
We'll make the opening ceremonies, right!?

Ritsu:
Relax, we'll make it.

Yui:
They'll have tasty food there, won't they!?　

Mio:
Oh wow, two days surrounded by music!

Tsumugi:
Yui-chan, yakisoba, let's eat yakisoba!

Ritsu:
Just enjoy ourselves!

Mio:
Let's do this right!

Tsumugi:
I can't wait!

Azusa:
Are you guys gonna be.. a problem?

Sawako:
Please don't talk so damn loudly, okay..?

Yui:
It's crowded.

Mio:
Oh man, there's already so many people here.

Ritsu:
Are you okay? It hasn't even started.

Azusa:
This sure is amazing all right.

Yui:
There must be three hundred million people!

Azusa:
That's more than the population of Japan.

Swako:
Come on, girls! That slacker attitudes end here!

Yui:
You were slacking more than any of us were!

Ritsu:
You were flat on your back with massive hangover!

Sawako:
I've cast off the mere of yesterday.
The festival entrance, beyond there lies a battlefield.

Ritsu:
Laying it on a little thick?

Sawako:
The wristbands you've got in exchange for you tickets are your passports into this festival. If you loose them, you won't be able to allowed that again, so keep an eye on them.
Okay, before we go in, let's go to the camping area. We need to secure place to sleep tonight.
Damn, too late. The flat area is already taken up. We'll have to settle with the inclined area.

Yui:
Huh? But won't our blood pool in our head while we sleep?

Ritsu:
You sleep with your head up hill dummy.

Ritsu:
Wow, you're really an old hand at this.

Sawako:
All right. Put your things inside the tent.

Tsumugi:
Here goes.

Yui:
Mugi-chan?

Tsumugi:
Yahoooo! It's a bit stuffy, but this is wonderful!! Rather painful on the back though!

Ritsu:
Yeah we get it, come'on!


Sawako:
Do you have everything you need with you!?

Mio:
Yes, ma'am!

Sawako:
Have you all put on your sunscreen!?

Azusa:
Yes, ma'am!

Sawako:
Have you brought something to drink!?

Yui:
I got it all covered! Me heat stroke countermeasures are in place!

Sawako:
That's not good! You should have a sport drink!

Yui:
Should I leave this here?

Sawako:
No. Bring it. Water is useful for washing your hands or pouring over yourself when you get hot.

Ritsu:
I guess some people enjoy being over-attentive about this stuff.

Sawako:
[screams] Why aren't you wearing your sneakers!?

Tsumugi:
I didn't bring any other shoes with me.

Yui:
Don't worry, Mugi-chan, I'll lend you my flip-flops!
I bought them because I thought we might play in the river.

Ritsu:
Do you even remember why we were here?

Tsumugi:
Yui-chan, thank you.

Yui:
Don't mention it.

Sawako:
Wait a minute, what about bug repellent?

Tsumugi:
Bug repellent present and accounted for, miss!
Here.

Yui:
Thanks alot, Mugi-chan.

Tsumugi:
And now, here's some for you.

Mio:
This reminds me of grade school hike for some reason.

Yui:
It's your time, Mugi-chan. Give me the bottle so I can spray some on you!

Tsumugi:
Thank you, but I can take care of it myself.

Yui:
[Groans] But I wanna make the bottle go "Pshh" too!

Tsumugi:
Alright, you can.

Mio:
Yup, definitely gradeschool.

Yui:
Ritchan, Azunyan, I'll get you guys next!

Sawako:
All right then, are you done doubling?

Ritsu & Yui:
When did Sawa-chan get over there!?

Sawako:
Forward march!

Staff:
Here you are.

Mio:
The Natsu Rock Festival, is about to begin!!


Sawako:
All right, let me explain how the grounds are laid out.
First is the fire stage, the main venue. This is one of the two venues with the capacity of roughly 40 thousand. It has a gentle slope, so even people in the back can easily see.
This is the thunder stage, or the alternate main stage. It can hold over ten thousand spectators and tens of cutting-edge underground bands play here throughout the festival.

Mio:
People must go back and forth between the stages a lot.

Sawako:
Definitely. They are almost seven hundred meters apart.

Mio:
Even running a ten meters a second, it'll still take seventy second to cross!!

Ritsu:
Just breathe.

Sawako:
There's also this indoor stage where up-and-coming bands play.
The stage far distant back features jazz bands and more unique bands. There's even a small stage that features acoustic musicians.

Mio:
This is truly a festival of music!

Yui:
And food! Where is it that they sell food!?

Tsumugi:
Remember Yui-chan, I'm in it for a yakisoba!!

Ritsu:
Something's seriously off-kilter with these two.

Azusa:
No kidding.

Ritsu:
You know I'm pretty amazed that you just happened to have those tickets.

Sawako:
Well, I come to this festival every year.

Ritsu:
But why did you have six of them?

Sawako:
I was expecting to come here with some of my friends, but they canceled on me at the last minute.

Ritsu:
Do they hate you or something?

Sawako:
Of course they don't!! ...uh, I think..

Ritsu:
How am I supposed to react to that?

Yui:
Mio-chan are you okay?

Mio:
You know, now that I'm actually here, it's really, hot and crowded.. [gasps]

Singer:
Let's get started! Are you ready!?

Crowd:
Yeah!!!

Singer:
All right, let's bring this song!!　

Yui:
Oh, wow!

Azusa:
Their sound is so big!

Mio:
This is really Natsu-Fest... This is..

Ritsu:
Oh yeah!!

Mio:
It's Natsu-Fest!!

Yui:
Mio-chan just made a Natsu-Fest debut!

Mio:
Isn’t this band fantastic!

Ritsu:
Oh yeah, this singers voice is awesome!

Sawako:
Alright, people, we're moving on!

Yui:
Huh!?
But I wanna listen to this bands more! Don't you?

Sawako:
My top-pick band is playing at the indoor stage pretty soon. It's a little far, so we're gonna have to sprint it!

Ritsu:
Maybe you should just go by yourself, Sawa-chan.

Mio:
Ritsu, Ritsu! I'm moving too, I'm going over to the thunder stage!

Ritsu:
Right now?

Mio:
Come on let's hurry! We don't wanna miss the opening!

Yui:
Mio-chan, I'm gonna stay here okay!?

Tsumugi:
Yes, I'll stay here too!

Mio:
Okay, we'll see you guys later then!

Ritsu:
We'll touch base later and meet up somewhere, okay?

Mio:
Hurry, hurry!

Ritsu:
Alright, I'm coming!
See you later, have fun! Hey Mio, wait up!

Azusa:
You sure about this?

Yui:
You wanna stay here and listen to this great band too, don't you?

Azusa:
And what about you?

Tusmugi:
Yes, well, I can't really run in flip-flops!

Mio:
Oh, Ritsu, Ritsu!

Ritsu:
Huh!? What is it!?

Mio:
This bands' guitarist is a lefty!

Ritsu:
Oh, you're right!

Mio:
You were right! Lefties really do look kind of weird! But I'm really no one to talk though!

Yui:
I'm glad that you find the fellow yourself final, but could you please bring down your notch.　

Azusa:
Yui-sempai's entirely fixed during at the stage! I hope that being here inspire her to take practice more seriously from now on.

Yui:
Azu-nyan! I wanna ask you an important question.

Azusa:
Yes? Ask me what?

Yui:
How do you think their bassist gets his hair stay like that!? I mean that's so cool!

Tsumugi:
It has to be naturally curly.

Azusa:
You too, Mugi-sempai!?


Tsumugi:
It's popular..

Yui:
It's okay, we'll stand in line with you.

Azusa:
Yeah let's go!

Tsumugi:
Right!

The yakisoba stall guy:
Excuse me, everyone! Sorry xxx all sold out!　

Azusa:
Mugi-sempai!

Yui:
Just stay strong! Don't let it get you down!

Tsumugi:
Okay, let's go get what YOU want to eat.

Azusa:
Yui-chan..

Yui:
Ahh mistake! I just wanna go home now...

Azusa:
Please don't throw a tantrum.

YUi:
Oops, got a touch!

Azusa:
She's snapped right out of it!

Yui:
It's from Ritchan.
We'll be at Fire Stage from 2pm and Thunder Stage from 3pm and the Fire Stage at 4pm.

Azusa:
Wow, tough schedule!

Tsumugi:
Right! I'll run there now. Oops!

Yui & Azusa:
Mugi-chan/sempai!!

Tsumugi:
Uh...

Sawako:
Yeahhh! These guys rock!!

Band guy:
Thank you!


Yui:
God, it's down to a drizzle now.

Ritsu:
We have some time to kill before the next band we wanna see.

Yui:
Is anybody hungry? We missed lunch and I'm starving.

Azusa:
You ate crapes and ice cream and funnel cakes, remember!?

Yui:
That's desert, not lunch silly.　

Mio:
Tell you what, I'll go buy dinner for us, is that okay?

Yui:
Oh hey, I'll go with you.

Mio:
Don't worry, I've got this. You guys take up a spot for us.

Ritsu:
Okay, you know that the river that runs through the middle of the boardwalk area? We'll wait for you there.

Ritsu:
So, should we set up here?

Azusa:
It looks good!

Tsumugi:
Mio-chan!

Yui:
Welcome back!
Thanks for getting food!

Mio:
They were selling T-shirts. Look! It's for that band with the lefty guitarist!

Yui:
[cries]

Ritsu:
Where's dinner!?

Mio:
How's the look!

Ritsu:
Wow, that's nice! I think I wanna get one too!

MIo:
Why don't we all buy one?

Tsumugi:
I want one as well!

YUi:
Lemme see, lemme see!

Mio:
See, what do you think?

Ritsu:
Text from Sawa-chan. She said she bought a bunch of takoyaki for us to share.

Yui:
Ah! Takoyaki!


Sawako:
[sighs in relief] Myself again.

Yui:
They even have bats here.

Tsumugi:
It's amazing.

Azusa:
I have pins and needles all over..

Ritsu:
You're red as a lobster again this year.

Azusa:
I use a whole bunch of a sunscreen, but it didn't work for me..

YUi:
It's okay, you look so cute!

Azusa:
[cries]

Sawako:
Well, I'm going to turn in now.

Ritsu:
Huh, already?

Sawako:
My neck's killing me from the head-banging.
You thought that it was because of my age, didn't you?

Ritsu:
Huh!? Perish the thought! Perish the thought!


Azusa:
Sempai?

Yui:
Huh? Hey Azunyan.

Azusa:
What are you doing up here all by yourself?

Yui:
I've been listening to all the songs in the distance. They really do play music all night, don't they?
Come'on, sit down.

Azusa:
O-okay. Aren't you getting bitten by mosquitoes out here?

Yui:
Not a problem! I'm wearing two bug repellant wristbands!
Here, I'll give you one.

Azusa:
Thank you.

Ritsu:
Goodness gracious me! Are you two having a secret little chat?

YUi:
Come on over you guys. Let's listen to the song from here for a bit.

Mio:
It's almost like a dream, isn't it?

Azusa:
Yeah. Feels kind of magical.

YUi:
Yeah music's played non-stop in a wide-open place like this is wonderful.

Ritsu:
Every one of the bands I saw today was totally awesome.

Tsumugi:
Right. The music's energy, its intensity was completely incredible.

Yui:
Yeah, but, I think our performances are even more amazing.

Ritsu:
When'll you get off comparing us to pros!? My point is, you should get good enough to play guitar without flubbing notes before you say stuff like that.

Yui:
Ouch, you hit my vulnerable spot.
Still, I do think we're all amazing than all of those bands. The way we become one, or, how do I explain it..
Right! It's our aura!

Ritsu:
Do you even know what the word "aura" means?

Yui:
Uh-uh.

Mio:
She’s right. After School Tea Time is an awesome band, too!

Ritsu:
Mio?

Mio:
Right, Yui?

Yui:
Right you are, Mio-chan!

Azusa:
You're right! We're just as good as these pro bands are!

Ritsu:
W-wait, you too!?

Mio:
Next time, we won't come to Natsu-Fest to listen, we'll come here to play!

Ritsu:
A-are you serious!?

Tsumugi:
Right, to play!

All:
Yeah!!

Ritsu:
Yeah you're right! Wouldn't it be awesome to get the chance to play here!?

Yui:
Yeah!
I hope that I can just keep on playing in the band with you guys forever and ever.

Azusa:
So do I.

Mio:
Uh-hum.

Ritsu:
So do I.

Mio:
Me too. Forever, and ever.

ED
Azusa:
I hope this letter finds you well, in spite of the lingering summer heat.
Summer vacation is halfway over, how have you all been since we last saw each other?
Hm, seems a little stiff and formal.
Tonchan is doing well again today. In addition to his usual five food pellets, he also ate a silce of cucumber. No, they don't really need to know the details of the Tonchan's diet.
How are your studies going? Well I hope. No, there's at least one who studies obviously won't be going well.
It's from Yui sempai!

Yui:
Azunyan, how are you?
Thanks a lot for looking after Tonchan over summer vacation! Right now we're studying really hard in the library!

Azusa:
Yui-sempai beat me to it! She's actually studying. I guess everyone really is busy with their studies. And Mugi-sempai is off in Finland. Please work hard to make sure your last high school summer isn't filled with regrets.
[sighs] I'm so bored. Oh forget this, I'm gonna go have fun!!!


Ui:
Wow it's so huge!

Azusa:
[chuckles] Isn't it? My mom said I shoud bring you guys a gift!

Ui:
Thank you very much!

Azusa:
Where's Yui sempai?

Ui:
After she came home from the library, she ate the lunch I made for her, and went back to her studies!

Azusa:
Wow, she really works hard when she applies herself.
Hm? Or maybe not.

Ui:
I wonder if she's decided to take a break. Anyway, I'll bring her cell this watermelon.

Azusa:
You're not slincing it!?

Ui:
Nope, her dream has always been to take a big watermelon that's been cut into half like this, and then eat through the seedless area in the middle with the spoon!
Hey sis! Azusa-chan brought over a watermelon for us, I'll leave it out here for you.
I just left it outside her door.

Azusa:
Oh? She changed her tempo.

Ui:
Yeah, she sounds like she's feeling happy.

Azusa:
Does that mean she's eating while playing the guitar?

Ui:
Yeah, it was just like this at lunch time too.

Azusa:
Huh? At lunch time? You had chilled soba noodles?

Ui:
Yeah, but you get the summer drawdown if you only eat noodles, so I made tempura too.

Azusa:
Huh! Tempura, watermelon... Sempai, don't eat thaaaaat!!

Ui:
Huh? What's wrong?

Azusa:
Yui-sempai! Oh my goodness.

Huh..? It was a dream?
Hm? Coming!

Ui:
Good afternoon!

Azusa:
Hi Yui, come in! Sorry I had sort of conked out for a few minutes.

Ui:
Who are you?

Azusa:
You came to my house, so you know who I am!

Ui:
Sorry, for a second I didn't recognise you.
Azusa:
Sheesh. [yawns]

Ui:
You look sleepy.

Azusa:
I was watching TV last night and before I knew it it was really late. So I've been walking around the house didn't much had a sleep all day today.　

Ui:
You get lazy over vacation without realising it.

Azusa:
So what do you wanna do today?

Ui:
Um.. why don't we invite Jun-chan along and go hang out?

Azusa:
Didn't she say that her jazz club was gonna have practice everyday over summer vacation?

Ui:
In that case, why don't we take her a care package?
| don't think anyone's in there.

Auzsa:
I guess that jazz club takes Obon day off too. I'm not really surprised. Oh hey, since we're here and all, why don't we go eat in the light music club room?

Ui:
Oh, can we?

Azusa:
Yeah, let's go do it. We'll need the key to get in though. I wonder if any teacher is here.
Excuse us ma'am.

Sawako:
Oh? Who are you?

Azusa:
You were there at Natsu Fest when I got this way!

Sawako:
Relax, I was joking. So what brings you here?

Azusa:
We came to deliver a care package to the Jazz club, but no one was there.

Sawako:
Yeah, it's just because of the Obon holiday. The other teachers are all the way visiting their families or on trips and such, so I'm holding down the fort. It's letting me get a lot of extra work done.

Azusa:
Oh really, it is?
So anyway, we came to see if we could borrow the key to our club room.

Ui:
Be my guest.

Sawako:
But I didn't get you anything.

Ui:
Don't mention it, you always take good care of my sister.

Sawako:
Oh not at all, I'm in their dept for imposing on them and slacking off in the clubroom.

Azusa:
What a great sister!


Azusa:
Have you gotten any texts from Jun-chan?

Ui:
Not yet. I wonder what's keeping her.
Maybe she's already gone somewhere else to hang out for the day. Would you rather have peach or plum?

Azusa:
Plum!

Ui:
Here you go.

Azusa:
Thanks.

Ui:
You know it's kinda warm in here today.

Azusa:
Yeah.

Ui:
It's so quiet.

Azusa;
If we had other members, maybe I'll be practing like them right now.

Ui:
Hey hey, wanna go out and catch a movie?
Azusa:
That might be fun. Maybe we could go see a summer horror movie.

Azusa:
Mio-sempai?
I get it, she's training herself to overcome her fears by going all by herself to see horror movies! It's already scary right now. I wonder if she's gonna be able to handle this.
That's amazing. Has her training paid off? But if this film stays true to the horror movie formula, the next scence is probably gonna get extra scary...!
No way! She didn't even flinch at that scary scene! Running down the list of possibilities, this either isn't Mio, or she's passed out!
Oh no. I knew it, I thought something was weird... Mio sempai's cell phone? But they said to turn off our phones during the movies. Sempai!!
...A dream? Ui, your cell.

Ui:
Sorry, I fell asleep. Hey, it's from Jun-chan. Look!
Like we thought, she had a day off. She said she went to visit her grandparents out in a country.
It's kinda lonely, without Jun-chan around.

Azusa:
Um.

Ui:
When you get back, let's have a lots and lots of fun, okay?


Ui:
You said you wanted to see this one, right?

Nah, let's just skip the horror movie and see this one instead.

Ui:
Oh, okay, but there's a pretty long way until the next time they show it.

Azusa:
Well let's go kill some more time somewhere then Okay?

Ui:
Mm-huh.

Azusa:
That reminds me. I didn't send out my late summer greeting texts yet. How about postcards? But I spend way too much at Natsu-Fest so money's tight for the rest of the month. Maybe I shoud have gotten a summer job after all. Plus once Jun-chan gets back we have to go out and stuff.

Ui:
How about this job?

Azusa:
The pay is a little low, isn't it?

Ui:
How about this?

Azusa:
150 dollars per day sounds a little bit fishy to me..

Ui:
Let's see... How about that?

Azusa:
Lottery assistants?

Ui:
Let's go check it out!



Ui:
Seventh prize, a pack of tissues.

Ui & Azusa:
Thank you very much for playing today.

Azusa:
All that's left now is first prize, the trip to Finland, and seventh prize of pack of tissues. Which means that there's only one red ball and one gold ball left in there.

Tsumugi:
I'd like to play.

Azusa:
Mugi-sempai! I thought you were in Finland!

Tsumugi:
Yes. But I had the overwhelming urge to play the shopping archade lottery, so I came back home a day early. I've always dreamed of spinning this rattering contraption round and round and winning some tissues.

Azusa:
Oh please God if you're listening, please grant her wish of winning a packet of tissues..!!

Ui:
And.. seventh prize! A big packet of tissues!

Tsumugi:
Oh, hooray!

Azusa:
Good for her. But that means that the only prize left in there now is the grand prize, trip to Finland!

Ui:
Why don't you give it a roll, Azusa-chan?

Tsumugi:
I have an extra ticket you can use.

Azusa:
Alright.

Ui:
And... [cheers]
We have a winner!

Azusa:
Hey, wait a minute.
This is just another dream! Ui, Mugi-sempai, please pinch my cheeks right away!

Ui:
Is this okay?

Azusa:
Um. I knew it.

Ui & Tsumugi:
One, two.

Azusa:
It doesn't hurt!

Tsumugi:
So what if it's only a dream?

Ui:
You can go to Finland anyway.
Congratulations on winning Azusa-chan. Congratulations....

A boy:
Teto, teto!!!

Azusa:
[gasps] I woke up before I went on a trip! Not only that, I slept through the movie...


Jun:
Where is she!?

Ui:
She'll be here any minute.

Azusa:
Sorry! It took a little while to get ready.

Jun:
Uh? Who are you?

Azusa:
I knew you were gonna say that!

Jun:
How come your skin is so tan now?

Azusa:
I guess I just burn right away when I got outside in the sun.
Jun:
Outside?

Azusa:
Oh! The light music club went to Natsu Fest.

Jun:
Natsu Fest? How did you swing that!?

Ui:
Maybe you should have joined the light music club, Jun-chan?

Jun:
I-I'm not jealous of you or anything!

Ui:
They went to the beach for the training camp the last two years. My sister said that they go to a summer house with a recording studio.

Jun:
A summer house with a studio!? Ummm.

Azusa:
Wanna join up, Jun?

Jun:
I had no regrets!



Ui:
Jun-chan your swim suits are really cute!

Jun:
Aha thanks! I bought a brand new one this year.

Ui:
Azusa-chan, are you done changing yet?

Azusa:
Aw, please don't look at me!

Jun:
Well, those are some impressive tan line.

Azusa:
[cries]

Ui:
Oh, Azusa-chan.

Jun:
Hey I got it. If you completely cover up, it'll solve everything!

Azusa:
Cover up?

Azusa:
Yeah!

Ui & Jun:
Let's play!

Azusa:
That'll make me stand out even more.
I'll work on all-over tan at the side of the pool, so you go have fun!

Jun:
Here comes! And catch!

Ui:
That's so cool!

Jun:
I feel kinda bad about leaving Azusa.

Ui:
Hey, let's go over and check in on her.

Azusa:
Oh my.

Jun:
Oh well, we're really high up, aren't we?

Ui:
Hey, why don't you go first, Azusa-chan?

Ritsu:
If you're gonna slide, you'll need this!

Azusa:
Huh?

Ritsu:
It's yours. Take it.

Azusa:
Ritsu-sempai, what are you doing way up here!? And what's with the yakisoba?

Ritsu:
This is the yakisoba slider, it's all the rage. Look there. You go down the water slide like that.

Azusa;
Huh? Hey wait a minute, isn't that.. Yui-sempai? And Mugi-sempai? And Mio-sempai!?

Yui:
Darn it!

Tsumugi:
Oh, I didn't get to eat any of that again.

Mio:
Ritsu! Order another for me!

Yui:
Me too!

Tsumugi:
And for me!

Azusa:
Huhh!?

Ritsu:
Go on Azusa, it's time for you to slide away.

Azusa:
Don't push! No one said anything about yakisoba..!

Ritsu:
Here!

Azusa:
Thank you, but I don't wanna any..

Ritsu:
No can't-do, you gotta take it.

Ritsu:
Have a nice trip!

Azusa:
[screams]

A boy:
Dad! Give my swim ring and toss it over here!　

Azusa:
.. Dream?

Ui:
Azusa-chan! We bought you some yakisoba.

Jun:
There was a long line, so it took a little while.
Hey, you've got a nice even tan now.

Azusa:
It's looking better.

Jun:
Yakisoba always tastes better when you eat it outside like this.

Ui:
I know what you mean.

Azusa:
Now that you mention it, Mugi-sempai was looking forward to having yakisoba at Natsu Fest, but they sold out fast and she never got to eat any.

Jun:
Going about Natsu-Fest again?

Ui:
When you guys were in the tent at night, I bet that you spent the whole time fooling around and making a ruckess.

Azusa:
That's for sure. Ritsu-sempai was her usual hilarious self and..

Jun:
Aww fine! I admit it! I'm jealous!! How come you keep having training camps like that!?

Azusa:
W-well.. I guess because we...

Tsumugi:
I have a summer house we can use.

Sawako:
Why don't I take you guys there?

Azusa:
We.. we don't have many members so we have plenty funds to go around!

Jun:
Umm. Oh, I envy you guys.

Azusa:
I can't tell her we went for free.

Jun:
You're so lucky in the light music club. Mio is gorgeous and she's great on the bass.

Azusa:
[chuckles] Yeah that's right.

Jun:
Yui-sempai is a great guitar player, too.

Azusa:
You think so? I've got to admit, I've been really surprised how much better she's gotten lately. It's pretty impressive.

Jun:
Well, that's Ui's sister for you.

Azusa:
But she can't be bothered to learn the lingo, and she can't read sheet music very well. She has a long way to go.

Jun:
I had no idea.



Jun:
That was so much fun!

Ui:
I hope we can go one more time before summer ends.

Azusa:
Yeah.

Jun:
Oh?

Yui:
Ui? Azu-nyan!

Azusa:
It's Yui sempai.

Yui:
Azu-nyaan!!

Ui:
Are you guys just heading home from the library?

Mio:
Yeah.
And, we're on the way over to the Sakuragaoka summer festival to unwind a bit.

Yui:
Sniff. Sniff sniff. Hey, you smell like a swimming pool, Azu-nyan.

Azusa:
Please don't sniff me. And it's because we all just came from the pool.

Yui:
Hey! You three shoud come and hang out with us at the festival, okay?

Ritsu:
Hook me up with another, pops!

A man:
Sure thing.

Azusa:
By the way Mugi-sempai, weren't you supposed to be in Finland?

Tsumugi:
Actually I came back a little early ‘cause I wanted to come to the summer festival. I'm bound and determined to eat yakisoba this time.

Mio:
Mugi, we found some!

Tsumugi:
I'll be back!

Yui:
Get your grilled corn right here! Now to eat it you gotta go like this!

Ritsu:
What are you, some kind of rodent?

Yui:
Here, you have some.
Isn't it terrific!?

Azusa:
It's a little bit charred, but it tastes totally delicious!

Yui:
Oh? You know the charred parts are my favorite!

Ui & Jun:
[chuckles]

Ritsu:
Okay now people, next up on the agenda is, mango shaved ice!

Yui:
Watermelon flavor for me!

MIo:
There's no such flavor!

Jun:
Strawberry for me!

Ui:
Me too!

Ritsu:
Grean tea and beans.

Yui:
Oh you're so traditional!

Mio:
I'll have melon.

Tsumugi:
I'd like a blue Hawaii.

Yui:
In that case, I'll go with a purple Argentina!

Mio:
Quit making up flavours!

Azusa:
I think I'll have the strawberry milk.

Yui:
Look at me! Look at my tongue!

Mio:
Would you stop that!?

Yui:
Your toungue is a funny colour too.

Mio:
Oh.

Ui:
Sis! Look, they've got a goldfish scooping booth over there.

Yui:
I'm so there! We'll put them in Tonchan's tank to keep on company!

Tsumugi:
But the goldfish might be eaten if we do that.

Ritsu:
Oh I'm sure that they'll be eaten pretty quick. They'll be like crunch! and mash! and rip! and tear!!

Mio:
Cut it out!

Yui:
But Tonchan is tiny, so it'll be safe.

Ritsu:
I was just kidding, so it'll be just fine.

Azusa:
My life is definitely more fun when I'm with these guys.

Yui:
Then let's get some goldfish!

Mio:
No! We can't!

Yui:
Huh?
Look! They're launching fireworks!

Ritsu:
What!? Why didn't they say anything about it! It doesn't look too far away. Let's get moving people!

Yui:
Whatcha doing?

Mio:
Yeah!

Yui:
Come on, let's go Azunyan.

Ritsu:
Hey come on!

Azusa:
They're so pretty... Is this real? Am I dreaming again?

Ui:
Azusa-chan! Where is my sister and the others?

Azusa:
I don't know, We got seperated.

Ui:
Would they be okay?

Azusa:
Yeah I'm sure they'll be just fine.

Ui:
You're right.

Jun:
Think we should head home?

Ui:
Sure.


Azusa:
Hey Jun. Why not join the light music club? There's still time.

Jun:
It's tempting... I'm in.

Ui:
Hey, good for you Azusa-chan.

Jun:
If you don't get any other new members next year that is.

Azusa:
I don't even wanna think about that.

Jun:
But there will be no point if all the cool people like Mio-sempai are gone.

Azusa:
Hah!? What did you say!?

Jun:
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

Azusa:
Today was a lot of fun. But, what if it was all.. Just another dream?
Awww! No, it's not a dream. I almost forgot, after this year is done, I'm going to be all alone.
Stop that! Think positive thoughts! I'll work hard with others and knock their socks off at the student festival!

Azusa's mother:
Azusa, we're finishing this watermelon without you!

Azusa:
NO! wait for me!

Yui:
I'm home! Ui! That's pretty weird, did I get home before she did? Huh? Leftovers lunch detective! Lucky! Down the hatch!
Huh? Yui here, hey Azu-nyan? So what's up with you? You sent me a what? A letter? A postcard? No I haven't seen one. Oh maybe this is it. Shaved ice and tempura don't go well together, so whatever you do, do not eat them together. Ah.. Azunyan.. What do I do..
Mio:
Let's see.. This is squared so that makes x.. hm?
Hello, it's Mio. What is it?

Ritsu:
[Chuckes] Wow, you picked up! Mio, where are you right now?

Mio:
I'm at home. Why?

Ritsu:
I'm at the station right now. Wanna go out and do something?

Mio:
Well, I still have an awful lot of prep work left to do, and summer class starts tomorrow.

Ritsu:
Come'on! You can do that tonight!

Mio:
If I go out, I'll be tired tonight and won't get anything done. I'm gonna take a pass.

Ritsu:
[Cries] Which is more important!? Me or getting a job!

Mio:
Whatever Ritsu, see ya.
For crying out loud, does Ritsu ever do any studying at all?
Ritsu again? Hello Ritsu.

Ritsu:
[Panting] My little missy, what kind of panties are you wearing?

Mio:
Geeez!! Leave me alone!!!

Ritsu:
[chuckles] Okay, I did the obvious gag and now I'm outta tricks. So, what do I do now?
Yui said that she was busy studying with Nodoka.
Hm? Mugi. I wonder where she's going. I'll sneak up on her. Huh?

Tsumugi:
WAH!

Ritsu:
Whaaaaa!

Tsumugi:
I noticed you standing back here, so I thought it would be fun to sneak up on you.

Ritsu:
You stole my idea.

Tsumugi:
It certainly is odd to run into each other here.

Ritsu:
It sure is. So where were you heading when you saw me.

Tsumugi:
Summer classes start tomorrow, right? I wanted to get my shopping out of the way before then.

Ritsu:
Oh, right. I was going to ask you if you had some free time and wanted to hang out a little while today.

Tsumugi:
Whoa.

Ritsu:
Ah, what's up?

Tsumugi:
Stand right there and don't move a muscle.

Ritsu:
Wouldn't dream of it.

Tsumugi:
Hello, this is Tsumugi. Would you mind if I postponed today's shopping for another time? Yes of course, thank you very much! I have all the time in the world!

Ritsu:
Do tell..

OP

Yui:
Previously on k-on!
Mugi-chan's eyebrows are takuan pickles! They're tasty!
Mugi-chan, I need another pickle.

Ritsu:
Don't hog them all to yourself, I want one two!

Yui&Ritsu:
Whoa! So tasty!

Yui:
Mugi-chan?

Tsumugi:
When both of my eyebrows are flipped from my face at the same time, I very quickly revert to gel form.

Yui & Ritsu:
Gel?

Tsumugi:
They have to be replaced with other pickles right now...

Yui:
Mugi-chan!

Ritsu:
Yui, you gotta buy some pickles!

Yui:
But where am I supposed to buy takuan pickles here!

Ritsu:
We'll just have to slap something on there and hope for the best!

Tsumugi:
I'm all better.

Ritsu:
Protractors work too!?

Yui:
Try something triangular..
Where did this blanket come from?

Nodoka:
You'll catch a cold sleeping in the clothes like that.

Yui:
I was studying, you should have woken me up in stead!

Nodoka:
Sorry for worrying about you.



Ritsu:
So, where should we go?

Tsumugi:
I leave it up to you.

Ritsu:
Wow, you're downright beaming.

Tsumugi:
Think about it, in all these years, this is the first time we're hanging out just the two of us!

Ritsu:
Now that you mention it, I guess it really is. All right then, I think I'll take you to some places that you normally never set foot in. Like a game centre for instance!

Tsumugi:
A game centre?

Ritsu:
What? You're not interested?

Tsumugi:
Um-m! It's no that! I wanna go very badly! When all of us went to one together that time, it was incredibly fun!

Ritsu:
[chuckles] I know, right? Good, it's all settled. We'll go there first!

Tsumugi:
Whooaa. A game centre...!!

Ritsu:
You get impressed with the littlest things.

Tsumugi:
What's this contraption over here that looks like a shandellier!?

Ritsu:
A coin game, I guess.

Tsumugi:
Whoa. And this thing with the steering ring and pedals?

Ritsu:
A racing game?

Tsumugi:
What in the world is this fishing poles doing indoors!

Ritsu:
It's a fishing game.

Tsumugi:
Which one should we play, Ritchan!? Every one of them looks like so much fun I really don't know which one I should try first!

Ritsu:
Take a breath.
Well let's see. For starters, I'd..

Tsumugi:
Ah! Let's try this one!

Ritsu:
Ha! Hmmm..ughh [cries]

Tsumugi:
Let me give it a try.
I have avenged your honour, Ritchan!

Ritsu:
Er.. Thank you?

Tsumugi:
I'd love to have this stuffed animal!

Ritsu:
Okay, first you press this button right over here.

Tsumugi:
Okay. Click. Aw.

Ritsu:
Almost. Let me take this.

Tsumugi:
Wow! Ritchan you are amazing!

Ritsu:
What did you expect?
Phew, it was a lucky.

Right, we got our pictures, now to add some effects.
We add this here and then..

Tsumugi:
Oh, what's this!

Ritsu:
[laughs] Check this one out!
We can even do this! Oscar!

Tsumugi:
I use this one on here. This effect looks surprisingly good on you.

Ritsu:
What am I, an old teaser?
I'll try this one on you, Mugi.

Tsumugi:
Ah! I'm a pig!



Yui:
[humming] Oh, yours looks really good too, Nodoka!

Nodoka:
Does it?

Yui:
Why don't we trade bites!

Nodoka:
Oh, that's alright. Yours looks more expensive than mine.

Yui:
Don't worry about it, I just wanna try yours.

Nodoka:
Really? Well then.

Yui:
Nodoka-chan, you...



Tsumugi:
Oh, that was fun.

Ritsu:
You know Mugi, seeing you this happy makes the whole day worthwhile.

Tsumugi:
I might well be dead over happiness overdose tomorrow.

Ritsu:
That's not okay.
We did burn through an awful lot of money though, which means our next stop will have to be kind of cheap. A dagashi candy store?

Tsumugi:
A dagashi store.. Oh, Ritchan.

Ritsu:
Huh?

Tsumugi:
Kitos spasivas gracias!

Ritsu:
Where the heck are you from?

Tsumugi:
Oh, this is the dagashi store?

Ritsu:
Yeah. Most of the items here are 20 or 30 cents. You can buy all you want without worrying too much about your wallet.

Tsumugi:
Oh really? Even this?

Ritsu:
Even that.

Tsumugi:
Even these things with little tiny skewers?

Ritsu:
Yup.

Tsumugi:
Even this tasty-looking fried things?

Ritsu:
Yup.

Tsumugi:
Even this huge sembei cracker?

Ritsu:
Yeah..

Tsumugi:
Wow, that's amazing! Is this the result of the price crush that everyone talks about!?

Ritsu:
No, I don't think so..

There are a bunch of different tricks when it comes to eating dagashi stuff.
For instance, to open a fugashi, you do this!

Tsumugi:
Oh, wow.

Ritsu:
And when you wanna drink one of these babies, you do this and..

Tsumugi:
Why do you do that?

Ritsu:
You can only take a little sips from this end, so it lasts longer.

Tsumugi:
Wow that's amazing.
Now, what's this? Ah! What would I do?

Ritsu:
With these, you swirl them and mush them together, and then you eat them. Go on. Try it.
See?

Tsumugi:
Hm.



Azusa:
The strawberry on your cake?

Yui:
She stole it! Just like that!

Azusa:
I don't get what the problem is here.

Yui:
It's not right! Who does stuff like that! Huh!? How could you not know!

Nodoka
Oh, come on, it wasn't all that stranger thing to do. And I would feel bad taking a piece of the cake itself.

Yui:
But taking the strawberry off the cake is like taking its clown! Or even its heart! Or its very soul!

Nodoka:
I'm sure it's only that way to you.

Yui:
No! it's that way to the whole world!!

Ui:
Is that my sister?

Nodoka:
Alright, fine. Here. You can have the chestnut off my cake. That should make us even, right?

Yui:
NOooooo! Azunyan! This is weird, right!? Nodoka-chan is wrong about this, isn't she!?



Tsumugi:
Oh. I had so much fun today.

Ritsu:
I'm glad to hear it.

Tsumugi:
You know so many places that I never dreamed existed! It's absolutely amazing, Ritchan!

Ritsu:
[chuckles] More. Praise me more.

Tsumugi:
I got this for only 5 dollers. And I was able to feel full for just one doller. You're master of having fun without spending a lot of money.

Ritsu:
Indeed I am. But even so, the money that we spent today is a total fortune to the common masses.

Tsumugi:
It is?

Ritsu:
Pretty much. To tell you the truth. There was this time last month when...

Oh, ugh. Sorry Mio, could you spare me a little money to help cover this?

Mio:
What? Again? So how much are you short?

Ritsu:
Really you lend me some money!? In that case, can I buy these drum sticks!? This new sheet music!? And this CD just came in!? Oh can I, can I please!?

And then out of the blue, that mean old Mio smacked me upside the head for no reason.

Tsumugi:
She smacked you? Hmm.

Ritsu:
Ah.. is something the matter?

Tsumugi:
Actually, there are some favour that I like to ask you.

Ritsu:
If it's money you need, I'm broke.

Tsumugi:
I know.

Ritsu:
Ehehe, he..

Tsumugi:
No! I didn't mean it like that!
It's just something that I've been yearning for for ages now.

Ritsu:
Been yearning for?

Tsumugi:
The thing is.. I'd like you, to whack me on the head!!

Ritsu:
Eh... You what?


Ui:
Sis, it's almost time!
Summer classes start today, you remember? You need to get up!
Oh, I'm sorry. You're all ready yet.

Yui:
Yep.
It's been a while since I had to get up early, and I accidentally set my alarm an hour early.


Mio:
I wore my uniform out of force of habit. What am I gonna do..

Yui:
Oh! You're in uniform! Oh no, We're supposed to wear our uniform, weren't we?

Mio:
Well, doesn't it make sense to wear school uniform to a place like this?

Yui:
What? Really? I didn't know.

Ritsu:
Good morning! Wow, you're early for once in your life.

Yui:
Ritchan, what are we gonna do? It sounds like we were supposed to wear school uniform to summer classes!

Ritsu:
Huh? No, of course we are not. Look around.

Yui:
Wow, you're right.

Ritsu:
Actually, I'd say it's the people in uniform who are in distinct minority.
Oh my gosh, what if Mio is the only one!? Oh! See that girl there? She's the only one here who's wearing uniform [teases].

Mio:
Quiet!
It says we can wear whatever we want, so it's really no big deal!

Tsumugi:
Good morning.

All:
Hum?

Tsumugi:
It took ages to get changed this morning.

All:
G-good morning.

Yui
Wow, Mugi-chan looks like she's going to the beach. Wait! Is everyone going to the beach after the class?

Mio:
That isn't on the schedule.

Tsumugi:
Let's hurry in, shall we?

Mio:
Hey Mugi.

Tsumugi:
Yes?

Mio:
You left the tag on your dress. And with this outfit, wouldn't going without socks look whole lot better than this?

Tsumugi.
Hmm.

Ritsu:
Hh! Don't tell me she..

Tsumugi:
I'd like you to whack me on the head!

Ritsu:
Erm, you know, it really hurts..

Tsumugi:
I want you to do it to me anyway!

Ritsu:
If you are that dead set on it, I guess I can do it.

Tsumugi:
You can?

Ritsu:
Just a little tough, okay?

Tsumugi:
Whenever you're ready!

Ritsu:
You're not being watched by security detail, are you?

Tsumugi:
No, there aren't any. Don't worry.

Ritsu:
Then here goes.

Tsumugi:
Ready.

Ritsu:
Uh, erm.. Maybe I'll go with.. chop?

Tsumugi:
Do it as hard as you like!

Ritsu:
Er.. whack..?
I can't do it! Forget it.

Tsumugi:
Huh?

Ritsu:
It doesn't work if someone asks you to. It has to be spontaneous, okay?

Tsumugi:
Spontaneous?

Ritsu:
Yeah! I can't whack you in the head if you haven't done anything wrong. But if you were to do something incredibly dipsy, I'll smack you out right in the head.

Tsumugi:
Dipsy, huh?

Yui:
Right? Nodokachan was crazy to do that, right?? When you offer somebody a bite of your cake, they don't eat the strawberry on the top.

Ritsu:
Mugi couldn't possibly be trying to..?

Mio:
Are you sure she's not just messing with you?I remember one time when Ritsu ate a strawberry on my cake and I whacked her, so I can understand how you feel but still..

Tsumugi:
Hmm.

Yui:
Nodoka-chan ate it! This is..

Ritsu:
No doubt about it.

Mio:
I guess we should look though the study guide first.

Yui:
I wonder if there's any books...

Ritsu:
Mugi, come here!
I knew it, you're trying to be a class clown.

Tsumugi:
Did I do it wrong?
I thought that this would be the least appropreate outfits to wear for summer classes.

Ritsu:
I'm afraid it's just too vague and uncommitted to really work. For a gag like that to be effective, it has to be totally in your face.

Tsumugi:
Sure is hot today, Mio-chan.

Mio:
Of course it is.

Tsumugi:
I see.

Ritsu:
Hey! Don't take notes!? Are you really eager to get whack upside the head, Mugi?

Tsumugi:
Uh-huh.
You and Mio-chan always express affection in intimate physical ways.
So do Yui-chan and Azusa-chan. I'm the only one who doesn't have that kind of intimate bond! Though I love being physically intimate!

Ritsu:
Uh, don't you think you're obsessing a little here?
Hm, alright Mugi, if you really are that determined, I'll help you out.

Tsumugi:
You mean it!?

Ritsu:
Now the key is the total lack of shame! Once you start a gag, you committ and see a xx to the bitter end, understood!?

Tsumugi:
Yes, ma'am!

Mio:
I have to say, I'm kind of surprised that You and Ritsu decided to go to college.

Yui:
Erm, Sawa-chan told us that it was way too late to start job hunting, so we might as well try.

Mio:
It's also a little late to begin studying for college entrance exams..

Yui:
Woo, headbands!

Ritsu:
Ready?

Tsumugi:
Hm!

Ritsu:
Mio!
I will pass my exam for sure.

Mio:
Quit goofing around!

Tsumugi:
So will I, Mio-chan.

Mio:
Hm? Mugi, those are great on you.

Ritsu:
Huh!? Why in the world would you put on normal glasses.

Yui:
It's so blazingly bright in here I can't read anything!

Ritsu:
You, look really close. If you squint real hard out, the words will suddenly pop out from the passages when you see it!

Yui:
I saw! I saw it, it was letter A!!

Mio:
You did not!

Tsumugi:
I can see it too, judging from the context surrounding this passage the answer is, A.

Mio:
Nicely done.

Ritsu:
Ah! Why did you see it so properly!

Tsumugi:
Sorry I couldn't help myself!



A staff:
Your ID card is ready, miss.

Mio:
I wish I'd brought more flattering picture with me. This one looks terrible.

Ritsu:
Ha! Well mine turned out pretty good. I'm rather shy and reserved to see.

Mio:
This is not a place for goofing off!

Tsumugi:
Here is mine.

Ritsu:
Yes! That should work!

Mio:
Um? oh I get it, you two just put stickers over the picture. Your eyes are half closed.

Ritsu:
What the fuck were you thinking, the normal one was funnier!!

Tsumugi:
It was?

Yui:
Look, look!

Mio:
Your sister?

Yui:
He he, I kind of submitted her picture by mistake.

Ritsu:
Wow, you know you just can't beat fresh ditz.

Tsumugi:
Hmm.
I tried, I tried so hard I don't get it!

Ritsu:
I know you're trying your hardest, but it's gonna be a lot harder than thought it would be to get you whacked in the head. And it'll take a lot to get Mio to whack YOU of all people.

Tsumugi:
May even be impossible.

Mio:
Oh, look there they are.

Yui:
You're right! Thanks for waiting for me.

Ritsu:
Sure.

Mio:
Come on, let's go home.
You do remember that tomorrow is the school day, right?

Yui:
Of course I remember. It'll so great to everybody in class again.

Mio:
It sure will.


Azusa:
Looks like there's an extra piece of cake. It'll be kind of hard to divide this into fifth.

Mio:
Rock paper scissors?

Azusa:
Oh come on, no way! I'm terrible at that stupid game.

Yui:
All right, then let's settle it with the old-fashioned way.

Azusa:
Hm. Very well, I'll take you on.

Ritsu:
OH! Okay, the winner gets the cake and loser gets a forehead flick from everyone here in the room.

Mio:
A forehead flick?

Yui:
Oh yeah, let's do it!

Ritsu:
Throw the game, if you lose, you'll get smacked fore sure!

Tsumugi:
I got it!

Ritsu:
Okay, let's start. I'll get it going. Ready? Five!

Yui:
Ready, set.. uh, three?

Azusa:
Ready, seven!

Mio:
Ready, one!

Tsumugi:
Ready, two! Aha! Uh...

Ritsu:
[cries]

Mio:
Who loses at the game they suggested?

Yui:
I'm so jealous, Mugi-chan.

Mio:
Well let's eat quickly and get on to practicing.

Yui:
Yeah, I finally get to eat my strawberry so I won't even put up a fight this time.

Tsumugi:
Huh..

Mio:
I remember when Ritsu eat a strawberry on my cake and I whacked her, so I can understand how you feel.

Tsumugi:
Hm!

Yui:
Ah...

Mio:
[sobs]

Yui:
Nodoka-chan!

Nodoka
Hm? What on earth is the matter?

Yui:
Just look at her!
She had her strawberry stolen and she's heartbroken! She's in tears!!
You see? That's how important the strawberry is, Nodoka-chan!

Nodoka:
I apologise for hurting your feelings then.

Yui:
Oh, you finally understand, Nodoka-chan..

Tsumugi:
Mio-chan, I'm so sorry.



Mio:
You want to be hit?

Tsumugi:
I'm sorry. I know how silly it sounds.

Ritsu:
No way. This is all Mio's fault for not reacting to any of your gags.

Mio:
What, it is not! You really should have just said something to me about this in the first place. You just wanna love to have, right?

Tsumugi:
Wow, you'll do it?

Mio:
Sure, I guess it's not a bigger deal.

Tsumugi:
Kiitos, Mio-chan!

Ritsu:
Seriously, where are you from?

Tsumugi:
Okay, whenever you're ready!

Mio:
You are one strange girl. Mm..

Azusa:
Wow, she's really tense, isn't she?

Ritsu:
Why'd you hit ME!?


Ritsu:
[sighs] I guess nothing worked. I'm really sorry.

Azusa:
No. I should be the one apologising to you. I mean it was a very odd request I made.

Ritsu:
If you just wanna be bonked on your head, there are to be another way to get it done. For instance..

Tsumugi:
Thanks Ritchan, but I'm giving up on that.

Ritsu:
Really?

Tsumugi:
Oh, dear. You have a welt on your forehead. You know, you really make an excellent escort, Ritchan.

Ritsu:
Er..

Tsumugi:
You're so sweet and I know that you would do just about anything to help a friend. If you are a boy, the girls would all be lining up for you.

Ritsu:
Huh!? Umm.. How am I supposed to respond to that!?

Tsumugi:
Ah!

Ritsu:
Hm, yeah. Sorry about that. Well, you remember when I called you and asked you if wanted to hang out that day? I ran into Mugi after that and.. Huh? Where did we go? Candy store and Game centre, and that kind of thing. Mugis was totally into everything like a little kid.
Admittedly she's always like that. And then she was like,"I wanna be whacked on the head!" Can you believe it? That kind of thing has to be spontaneous, you know? So I.. oops, Mio, are you there? Why aren't you talking to me? Are you mad at me?

Mio:
Why?

Ritsu:
Um?

Mio:
Why didn't you invite me to come along with you two that day! I wanted to hung out with Mugi too!

Ritsu:
I DID invite you.
School princiapal:
I want to give a warm welcome back to all the students of Sakuragaoka high school. The long summer vacation is now over and the new school term is once again upon us. I hope that each and every one of you had a busy and productive summer. It gives me no end of joy to see all your tanned energetic faces here once again. The experiences that you gain in high school are irreplaceable and are crucial to your development and your productive sense.

Yui:
[yawns]

OP

Yui:
Summer vacation went by way too fast this year..

Ritsu:
It's not like you didn't have a lot of fun.

Yui:
Huh? Yeah well I suppose, but...

Mio:
How could you spend the time goofing off? How about college exams!?

Yui:
Aw..

Tsumugi:
We did managed to make a lot of wonderful memories, though.

Yui:
Natsu Fest, and the summer festival!

Tsumugi:
Going to that dagashi store.

Azusa:
Good morning!
Hi everyone! The second term is starting, isn't it exciting!?

Yui:
Ahh.

Ritsu:
I'm blind!

Azusa:
Second term means the big school festival! And our live show!

Ritsu:
Ah. So that's what you've got yourself warmed up about.

Mio:
We have to work hard to get ready for it.

Tsumugi:
Ah.. but first we've got this.

All:
Hmm?

Yui:
A marathon!?

Ritsu:
Has its hour at last come again this year!?

Yui:
That's it! I've decided that I'm going to a college that doesn't have marathons ever!

Mio:
Actually, your average college doesn't have marathons.

Yui:
Hm?

Yui:
I'm off to school!

Granny:
Oh. Hi, Yui-chan. Good morning.

Yui:
Good morning.

Granny:
Take care of yourself today.

Yui:
Okay. I'm cutting it kinda close so I have to go!

Granma:
You have a good day.

Yui:
It's time to eat!

Mio:
Huh? Mugi, you're having eel and rice for lunch?

Tsumugi:
I'm trying to build up my stamina to get ready for the marathon.

Ritsu:
Yeah, you're pretty strong alright, but you've never really had much in the way of stamina, you know?

Mio:
That's great. You're trying to overcome your shortcomings. Good for you, Mugi.

Yui:
Yeah! And I've been training hard by sprinting a top speed from home to school every morning!

Mio:
That's not training, Yui! That's just you oversleeping every day.

Yui:
Aha, I guess you pretty much caught me there.
I don't understand, why do we have to run a whole 42.195 kilo meters?? Ugh.

Azusa:
You realise it's not a full marathon. It's 4.5 kilo meters.

Yui:
It involves the whole bunch of running either way so it's basically the same thing..

Sawako:
If you really hate running that much why not consider wearing one of these to make it more fun for you? The rest of you too.

Mio:
Never gonna happen.

Ritsu:
Those would be harder to run in.

Azusa:
If the entire student body run around town wearing stuff like that, this would be the last year the marathon is ever held.

Yui:
Yes, that's it! You're right, Azunyan, that's a really great idea!

Sawako:
What are you talking about, I was kidding, it was a joke.

Tsumugi:
Your tea is ready, Sawa-chan.

Sawako:
Just what I've been waiting for.

Yui:
It's black.

Sawako:
Is it black sesame? Unique flavour. What's this invigorating frequence wafting through my mouth that's so xx ing to the sea.

Tsumugi:
To prepare for the marathon, I thought we should build up our iron resource to help fight anemia, so I brought blancmange made with kelp and hijiki.

Sawako:
Perhaps the normal kind might be better next time.

Ui:
Sis! This pair looks really comfortable to run in, doesn't it?

Yui:
Wow Ui-chan, you're right!
I'm not sure I wanna spend my whole allowance.

Yui:
Huh? AH! It's Sawachan!
Whoa, after all this time, I finally get to ride in your car!

Ui:
Ma'am, were you off doing your shopping too?

Sawako:
No, I was buying something that the school needs for the marathon. We teachers are splitting up all the work.

Yui:
Sports drinks and lots of paper cups.

Ui:
If you're working, is it okay to give us a lift?

Sawako:
Yes, it's fine. I was just about to head back to school while driving over the marathon course so I could check it out.

Yui:
Uh? Mochi and Azuki beans?

Sawako:
After the marathon, we'll be making oshiruko red bean soup in the school yard.

Yui:
Red bean soup!?

Sawako:
You wouldn't believe the work that goes into this marathon. There're shopping to do, checking the race course, filling preferment with the police. Back when I was a student at the high school, I thought the teachers had it so easy because they didn't have to run in that.

Yui:
Maybe I can run on my way through if there is gonna be red bean soup happy end.

Sawako:
Well, we made the course a lot tougher than last year, so I'm pretty sure you're gonna hate this all for it.

You start here in the business district. There'll be pastry shops with their sweet smells. Clothing boutiques with their vibrant colours, and general stores with their shelfs full of cute items. You have to overcome the temptation to window shop to put the bus route behind you. You'll cross the bridge, pass the residential district and find a vast expanse of the rural district. It's a leisurely one way road with heads of rice heavily laden with seeds. But after that, looming up ahead is heart-break hill, a demoralising monster of living hell coming or going. A little of heart-breaker, a battle against your own limitations. But if you're not victorious or will be lost, then you'll never reach the finish line! As soon as you conquer this trial and cross the hill, you're be greeted by the site of the check-point at this park! You'll need a little strength you have left for the final stretch! The finish line is so close you can taste it!! ...It's like that.

Yui:
Mmm..

Ui:
Look! We're close to my house!

Yui:
She doesn't have to be that eager about it.

Ui:
It's not that she's eager, it's that you've already given up.Ah!

Yui:
What's wrong, Ui?

Ui:
One of those mochi got mixed in with our stuff.

Yui:
[sighs] I can't believe the race is tomorrow..

Ritsu:
Hey, how many snacks are we allowed to bring?

Mio:
A marathon isn't a school hike, you know!

Yui:
Well I'd feel a lot more motivated about the race, if they just let us take some snack with us.

Nodoka:
We can't have snacks, but the teachers will have red bean soup ready and waiting for us after the race.

Yui:
As much as I love red bean soup, it stinks that we have to run all that way and make it all the way to the finish line in order to get any.

Tsumugi:
You're eating mochi with your rice?

Ritsu:
Please tell me you don't think eating sticky stretchy thing will make you tough and tenacious!

Yui:
Of course not! Sawa-chan gave it to me yesterday. When I tried to return it she said go ahead and eat it and do my best! [bites] It's real hard!

Tsumugi:
You know the race will have to be called off if it were to rain tomorrow.

Yui:
Ha! That's it! That's what will do! The marathon will be cancelled and we'll have red bean soup contest instead!

whether forecast:
There's a zero percent chance of rain tomorrow everywhere. It'll be a beautiful day. Perfect weather for hanging the laundry outside..

Ui:
What are you doing there, big sis?

Yui:
I'm making a string of upside-down teru bozu weather dolls. Granny told me from next door that if I did this, it'll be sure to rain.

Yui:
[groans] Why..? Aww.


Nodoka:
On behalf of all athletes, we hereby pledge to follow the rules of good sportsmanship. And we'll see this race through to the very end in a fair and open manner. Student council president, Nodoka Manabe, year three, class two.

Teacher:
All right everyone. On your marks, get set.

Ritsu:
Wow, they are all taking this pretty seriously.

Nodoka:
I'm going on ahead, okay?

Yui:
Hah. everyone here is trying way to hard.. Even Nodoka-chan.

Ritsu:
Yeah, and it's not like there's a big prize or anything for the winner. The way these things normally go, you'd have a bet going with judo club and the winner would get the loser's clubroom for the rest of the year.

Tsumugi:
Really?

Mio:
No, nothing like that happens.

Yui:
Ah! It's a nice day out so let's just think of it as a class hike! ..Even though there's no snacks.

Mio:
But if we run really slowly and finish dead last then... I don't want that kind of attention!All right, come on people, put some effort into it!

Yui:
Oh, not you too..?

Ritsu:
Hm? Still, it's kind of nice to leave campus on a school day and not get into any trouble for doing it.

Tsumugi:
And the weather is nice.

Yui:
Huh? You know, you're right!


Jun:
Wait..!

Azusa&Ui:
Huh?

Jun:
Let's run.. a little.. slower please..

Ui:
Sorry.

Azusa:
Mio-sempai.

Jun:
Huh?

Ui:
I thought you're running with my sister and the others.

Mio:
They're for the back in the pack.

Ui:
Was my sister actually running when you saw her?

Mio:
Well, I wouldn't exactly call it running. But she's with the other girls so I'm sure she will be alright.

Jun:
Mio-sempai! Why don't you and I run together!

MioEr, sure.

Ui:
Well you're full of energy all of a sudden.

Azusa:
You were at death's door a second ago.

Jun:
No, I wasn't! I-I was adjusting my pace, that's all. Let's move!

Ui:
You know, there're something really fun about being outside in fresh air when we normally being in a classroom having lessons.

Azusa:
And the weather is nice, too.

Jun:
Yeah. Hey, that bag is cute.

Azusa:
Let's come here and check it out on Sunday.


Yui:
Ha! Look at that cake! It looks.. delicious..

Tsumugi:
Huh?

Yui:
Woa! Catty![smiles at a boy]

Yui:
Woo, I've never seen that kind of juice before. It's brand new? And it's only one dollar!

Beverage vending machine:
How may I help you?

Yui:
That bin talked.

Ritsu:
Even if she had all the strength and stamina and endurance in the world, would there be a girl less cut out for running a marathon?

Yui:
AH!

Tsumugi:
Hm? Mio-chan!

Yui:
I'm so glad you waited for us! Thank you Mio-chan! Thank you!

Sawako:
Drink up. The finish line is just a stone's away now. Hang in there.

Nodoka:
Thank you very much, ma'am.

UI:
We're almost at the checkpoint, Jun-chan.

Jun:
I'm sorry, I can't go any further. Go on without me.

Azusa:
Huh?

Yui:
I'm so pooped.

Ritsu:
You shouldn't be wiped out this fast.

Yui:
Arts and culture club like ours, is that a big.. disadvantage.. in this race.. We're no match.. for the track and field club, or softball or the judo club.

Mio:
Come on, the light music club has its own way of doing things. Why don't we just act like we're light music club and try running to a rhythm.

Ritsu:
Hey, you're right. We should run this marathon while singing a song!

All:
Hm!

Yui:
Ohh.

Ritsu:
Whenever look at you I feel my heart go doki-doki. I get so giggly and wiggle like..

Yui:
You're going too fast!

Ritsu:
Huh? Fuwa-Fuwa Time is too tough for you? How about we try My Love Is a Stapler?

Yui:
Why is it this way, are nights like this my mind.. begin..

Tsumugi:
My mind begin.. to stray..I can't run and sing at the same time!

Ritsu:
Mugi's down for the count, too?

Mio:
I guess we could just sing in our head.

Ritsu:
Yeah, that's it!

Yui:
Ah!

Ritsu:
What's up?

Yui:
I forgot all the lyrics.

Ritsu:
You what!? The single 窶徑alala" is whatever you need to fake it!

Yui:
Ah, I can't..! Sing your songs, don't worry about me! Leave me, it's okay just go, oh survive..!

Mio:
Forget about singing then. Why don't you try thinking of something else you really like while you're running.

Yui:
Oh! I think I might be able to do that!

Yui:
Oh Yui, I can't possibly eat another..

Ritsu:
What the heck is she imagining?

Tsumugi:
Something pleasant, something pleasant..

Ritsu:
And she's trying too hard.

Tsumugi:
Ah! I've got it! What if we sing a song!?

Ritsu:
We're back to square one!Oh, w-what's the matter, Mio?

Mio:
Some lyrics just came to me.

All:
Oh!

Mio:
Heart break run my heart just shatters. Pound so hard it'll soon be tattered. Is it because you that my heart is gone?

Ritsu:
Oh, is this that runner's high that we've ever heard about?

Mio:
Or is it all because of the marathon?

All:
Fight on!!

Ritsu:
Hang in there, Mugi. We've officially conquered heart-break hill. It's level roads from here on in.

Ritsu:
Heeeey!!

Jun:
Huh?

Ritsu:
Oh you're Azusa's friend. Erm, don't tell me.. it's Sasaki, right?

Mio:
Suzuki, dummy.

Ritsu:
Yeah, yeah. You're Jun-chan.

Jun:
That's right. So you chose to stick with the rest of the light music club, Mio-sempai? Hm? Hey eh- where is Yui sempai?

All:
Eh? Ah..

Mio:
She's vanished!?

Ritsu:
She's lost at sea?

Mio:
How do we get lost at sea in the road?

Ritsu:
Yeah well I hate to say it but with Yui, it's entirely possible.

Mio:
Ahh.

Jun:
Ma'am! There's an emergency!

Sawako:
What's wrong?

Ritsu:
Yui! Are you around here?

Tsumugi:
She couldn't have simply wandered this far off the main road, could she?

Ritsu:
I doubt that even Yui would mistake a tiny game trail on the dense forest for the marathon course. Wait a minute, where are we!?

Tsumugi:
Ergh! Have we gotten ourselves lost at sea, too!?

Ritsu:
Did we underestimate the perils of a race? But nobody needs to worry! I've got a survival needs covered! There are edible mushrooms there, see? Now look right there, those really pretty ones with the red and white polka dots, those are ones that are highly poisonous.

Sawako:
Hey, you three. What are you girls doing up there.

Ritsu:
Ehehe.

Sawako:
Have you found Yui yet?

Tsumugi:
No, not yet. Up until right around here, we were running together singing a song to keep us in good sprit.

Ritsu:
What's she said, and that's when miss Akiyama here begin composing a bunch of lyrics in her head.

Mio:
I couldn't help it. Great lyrics were just coming to me.

Sawako:
Anyway, we better split up and look for her. I'll look over there, now get going.

Ui:
Jun-chan is taking a long time.

Azusa:
Wonder what's keeping the light music club.

Nodoka:
Good work, you guys. There's red bean soup waiting over there. You should go and get some before it's all gone.

Ui:
Sure. Should we go ahead and eat without them?

Azusa:
I guess so.

Nodoka:
Oh, and just one mochi each, alright?

Azusa & Ui:
Right.

Ui:
Jun-chan! Over here!

Jun:
Something is happened..! Yui sempai vanished somewhere along the course!

Ui & Azusa:
What!?

Ritsu:
Yui!!!

Mio:
It's no use. There's no sign of her.

Student A:
You know, now that you mentioned it, there happen a lot of UFO sightings in this area.

Student B:
Hey, why don't we use that as a research topic for the school festival?

Ritsu & Tsumugi & Mio:
Huh..

Ritsu:
You don't think you got herself abducted by aliens, do you!?

Mio:
[gasps]

Ui:
Hey everyone! Excuse me!

Tsumugi:
Ui-chan.

Ui:
Have you guys found my sister yet?

Tsumugi:
No. I'm afraid not.

Mio:
We've looked everywhere and can't find her.

Ui:
Jun-chan told me what happened. She disappeared right before you got to the park check point?

Ritsu:
Yeah. At least that's when we all first realised that she was missing.

Ui:
Then I think we'll find her hanging around somewhere in that area.

Yui:
Whoa..! It's standing!

Granny:
Your tea stem is standing upright. That means something good will come your way today.

Yui:
Really? But you know that the teru bozu weather dolls that you told me about didn't worked the way you said it would.

Granny:
Oh, it didn't?

Yui:
Wha! I really should get going now.

Granny:
Yes, I suppose you should. In that case, eat this before you take off. You need energy to run your hardest.

Yui:
Hm. Oh?

Granny:
Oh, another visitor?

Ritsu:
Do you have any idea how worried we all were!? And here you are, eating chestnut jelly cake without caring the world!

Yui:
I'm sorry! I tripped and skinned my knee just as granny was passing by. And she cleaned it up and put a bandage on it. And then, she invited me in for tea so I took a.. little break..

Ui:
Oh, were you hurt badly?

Yui:
Nah, it's just a little scrape.

Tsumugi:
Thank goodness, it wasn't anything serious.

Mio:
I'm just amazed that you newed a look for her here.

Ui:
The course passed my neighbourhood, so I thought there was a good chance she might be here. I'm sorry for the trouble she caused. I'll go ahead to the school now and let everyone know that she's okay and that nothing really bad happened to her. You guys just take your time finishing the race, okay?

Ritsu:
That's one level-headed girl.

Yui:
Let's take her up on her offer and take our time until the finish line!

Mio:
And one that's screwed up.

Ritsu:
We're gonna be dead last now that's for sure.

Tsumugi:
Oh that doesn't bother me.

Mio:
No way.. They'll all stare at us and I'll die of embarrassment.

Ritsu:
What's this I see? You tripping and getting even more fans?

Mio:
[gasps] Spare me the twisted rejection!

Ritsu:
Ahhh!


Azusa:
It's great news that Yui sempai is okay.

Ui:
Yeah, it really is.

Jun:
Hey, look the back!

Ui:
Hm?

Mio:
I know everyone's watching us.

Tsumugi:
It's okay. Let's just focus on crossing the finish line together.

Azusa:
Sempai!! If you don't hurry they are gonna run out of mochi for the red bean soup!

Ritsu:
What's up, Yui?

Yui:
Omochi..? It's that mochi!

Ritsu:
Huh?

Yui:
I ate that mochi with my lunch so that means there's gonna be one short for the red bean soup! And that means the person that finishes last won't be getting a mochi...

Ritsu:
What!?

Yui:
MOCHIIII!!

Ritsu:
Hey! Wait for us!

Tsumugi:
There's a one getting no mochi?

Mio:
I don't wanna finish last!!

Ritsu:
Wait!!

Nodoka:
They are all running faster all of a sudden.

Ui:
Wonder why.

Mio:
Where is she getting all this power from!?

Yui:
Mochiiiii!!!!

Ritsu:
Mochi really means that much to you!?

Mio:
I am not going to finish laaaaaaast!!!

Mio:
Uh-oh.

Student:
Hey, are you all right?

Mio:
I drew attention to myself..

Yui:
Let's thank they had enough mochi even for the person who finish last, right?

Ritsu:
Well of course, that makes perfect sense! They wouldn't have bought the exact same number of mochi as there are students now, would they?

Mio:
[sighs]

Ritsu:
Hm?

Mio:
Thanks to Yui's crazy idea, I ended up..

Ritsu:
My prediction came true.

Yui:
I'm sorry, Mio-chan.

Tsumugi:
Still, it was kind of fun, wasn't it?

Yui:
Yeah, I could get used to running marathons.

Mio & orange
Hey, speak for yourself!

Yui:
I'm really sorry. Hey, does anyone wanna have seconds of soup? There are still plenty of mochi left.

Ritsu:
The ones that are left are for the teachers.

Tsumugi:
Ah, speaking of teachers, where is Sawa-chan?

Mio & Ritsu & {Font color|#387f9c|Jun} & {Font color|red|Yui:}}
Huh?

Sawako:
Hey Yui, are you there? Where are you? There isn't gonna be any soup left. [sighs] I'm so hungry..
Yui:
Ah! He's so cute! Hehehe!

Tsumugi:
Mio, are you scared of it?

Mio:
Uh! I'm not scared. I just haven't reached the point where I think it's cute yet.

Yui:
Huh? But he IS cute. Right, Ton-chan? Hehe.

Tsumugi:
He looked at you!

Yui:
Ah, he's looking at me! I'm right over here! Ton-chan…

Tsumugi:
Hey, Ton-chan!

Yui:
You try calling him too, Mio-chan!

Mio:
Uh! Ton- …chan …'Kay, that was cute.

Yui:
Right, right?

Azusa:
Yui-senpai, if we're going to keep him, we have to look after him properly, too. The water must be kept at a precise temperature and changed regularly.

Yui:
Wow, he's higher maintenance than Gita!

Azusa:
He also has to be fed everyday.

Tsumugi:
Ah, if you ever run low on food, I'll bring some from home. We have Chinese pond turtles, Asian yellow pond turtles, and Eastern musk turtles, too!

Mio:
(She's an expert!)

Azusa:
That'd be a big help!

Yui:
Don't you worry; we're all gonna take real good care of you!

Mio:
That's right. We won't get sick of you and just throw you away.

Ritsu:
I'm sick of this! [whimpers] I'm sick of the drums! [crying]

Yui:
Rit-chan, what's the matter?


Mio:
What do you mean you're sick of the drums?

Ritsu:
Sorry! That was an exaggeration. However! Look at this. This is our club activity footage, recorded by the Student Council. I got it from Nodoka.

Tsumugi:
Ha, that's our freshman year!

Yui:
That takes me back!

Azusa:
I saw that one. We all saw Mio-senpai's --

Mio:
Ah, stop the video!

Ritsu:
No way! Look at where the drums are.

Yui:
You're all dark, Rit-chan.

Mio:
[wails in fear]

Yui:
Your forehead is nice and bright!

Ritsu:
Hey, shut up!

Mio:
I guess the lights just aren't hitting you.

Azusa:
Yeah, because you're way in back.

Tsumugi:
When looking from straight on, you're the only one of us who isn't visible.

Ritsu:
And it's not just this show. Last year's welcome show…

Tsumugi:
Ah, you're dark!

Ritsu:
And this year's welcome show…

Yui:
Oh!

Azusa:
I think I saw your foot.

Mio:
Wow, the camera misses you completely.

Azusa:
So… what do we do?

Ritsu:
…I wanna play another instrument.

Mio:
Huh? Wait just a minute, you can't just change instruments. Who's gonna play the drums if you don't?

Ritsu:
[squeaky whimpering]

Mio:
She hasn't thought this through! Besides, weren't you the one who said you hated how fiddly the other instruments were?

Ritsu:
That's true, but maybe we should try switching instruments every once and a while. Just for laughs.

Other four girls:
Huh?

Yui:
It sound like a lot of fun!

Tsumugi:
That's a great idea!

Mio:
Uh!

Yui:
Wanna try playing the guitar?

Ritsu:
Oh, is that ok?

Mio:
Ah!

Ritsu:
Tada!

Tsumugi:
Ah, that suits you rather well!

Azusa:
Yeah, looking real good, senpai!

Mio:
It seems out of character…

Tsumugi:
Why don't you try playing something?

Yui:
[wails]

Azusa:
What's the matter, Yui-senpai?

Yui:
Gita's cheating on me!

Azusa: You willingly handed him over with a smile on your face.

Yui:
Thank you, Gita. We had good times, you and I.

Azusa:
If it's not one thing, it's another.

Ritsu:
So, teacher, what do I do first?

Yui:
Me?! Teacher?! Ah! Sure, Rit-chan, I'll teach you!

Mio:
I'll just go make us all some tea. She'll get bored of this soon enough.

Yui:
You form the chords with your left hand, and you strum with your right one.

Ritsu:
Sorry, but I already know all that stuff?

Yui:
Uhh? What should I teach you then?

Azusa:
Fine, guess I'll be handling this! For now, let's try playing Fuwa Fuwa Time.

Ritsu:
Yes, ma'am! Let's see..

Azusa:
Uh, it might be easier if you played sitting down.

Ritsu:
Then I'll sit down. Ready.

Azusa:
Ok, the first chord in the song is an E. Your index finger goes on string 3 at fret 1, and uh, the middle on on string 5 at fret 2, and then your ring finger goes on string 4 at fret 2. Umm… your index finger goes here, and the middle one here, just like this, you see! Now, pressing down your fingers like that, strum the guitar.

Ritsu:
Hm!

Yui:
Um, Rit-chan? Try to keep your right hand really relaxed, uh, like a cooked noodle!

Azusa:
And keep the fingers pressing on the strings curled more. Some of the notes aren't coming out cleanly.

Yui:
Rit-chan, you need to hold the pick gently. Very gently.

Azusa:
Ok, the sound is starting to come together. Ritsu-senpai, keep your back a little straighter.

Yui:
You should move your left wrist foreword a little bit!

Azusa:
So, shall we move on to the next chord?

Yui:
It's pretty tough to play, isn't it?

Ritsu:
I'm not cut out for this.

Azusa and Mio:
Huh?

Ritsu:
Wow, it's a big pain to have to keep track of all that stuff. I had no idea…

Yui:
That's quite all right! Welcome back, Gita! Hehe, who's a good boy?

School girls:
Good morning, Miss Yamanaka!

Sawako:
Good morning! Good morning, Rit-chan!

Ritsu:
Oh, hey, Sawa-chaaa…ahh. (Ah, Sawa-chan is glowing!)

Yui & Tsumugi & Mio & Jun: & {Font color|#526e26|Nodoka:}}
Let's dig in!

Tsumugi:
Nodoka, your lunches always look so wonderfully delicious.

Yui:
Yeah, Nodoka-chan has always been a terrific cook!

Mio:
So's Ui-chan!

Yui:
Am I the luckiest girl in the world or what?

Nodoka:
I've noticed your lunches are always packed full, Mugi.

Tsumugi:
Mhm, I burn up a lot of energy!

Nodoka:
(On what?)

Tsumugi:
Mio, your lunches always look so cute and cuddly!

Yui:
Well, I guess your mother must still thing of you as her darling little girl, huh? Hehe.

Tsumugi:
…What's Ritsu doing?

Yui:
Just wandering around.

Nodoka:
Like a bird.

Mio:
Kinda like Cozy Powell, in a good way. (She's been restless for as long as I've known her; she gets bored so easily. But her drumming has been the one constant.)

Ritsu:
I'm back!

Yui:
Ha! Welcome home! Rit-chan, here! Have some of Nodoka-chan's omelet.

Ritsu:
Oh! Can I? …You already took a bite…

Ritsu:
And on that note, I'll be trying out the keyboard today!

Mio:
Exactly what note are you talking about?

Yui:
Another "Shine on, you crazy Rit-chan" installment?

Ritsu:
You don't, understand, Yui, I have to shine!

Yui:
Huh?

Ritsu:
When everyone has their eyes on you, that's when you sparkle! Like her!

Sawako:
Ahh… uh? What was that?

Ritsu:
Just look at her! Ever since Sawa-chan became our homeroom teacher, it seems like her skin's been glowing, and her hair's been silky and shiny. It's like she's blossoming or something!

Sawako:
Mhm! I guess I get more chances to take the stage -- a teacher's lectern, in this case -- now that I'm a homeroom teacher.

Ritsu:
And I wanna sparkle, too!

Mio:
So you're gonna try out the keyboard.

Ritsu:
Mhmhm.

Yui:
It said "Bingo"!

Azusa:
Can you read sheet music, Ritsu-senpai?

Yui:
It said, I read it fine!

Mio:
(How can she interpret that?) You're making trouble for Mugi, so-- …or not.

Tsumugi:
Ahhh! My keyboard it actually speaking! Ah! Oh, it just said "Mugi-chan"!

Yui:
It did, it did!

Mio:
Oh, brother.

Ritsu:
It's neat how you can get so many different tones out of the keyboard.

Tsumugi:
Hah, I'm getting all sorts of wonderful ideas for new songs!

Azusa:
(What kind of songs?)

Yui:
This is so cool!

Mio:
That looks like fun! Mugi, you think I might be able to have a try?

Ritsu:
[evil chuckle]

Mio:
Huh?! Stop that! I hate that! Ritsu, stop making that sound!

Ritsu:
Fine, I'm sorry! Ok?! What am I doing? Jerk!

Yui:
Hey, Rit-chan, aren't you gonna try playing the bass?

Mio:
No, not the bass!

Yui:
Why not?

Mio:
I'm on bass… and I don't ever wanna play anything but the bass. I only wanna be a bassist. Mm. I just love its low, deep sound. The way it supports all of you without ever standing out. I also like writing bass lines that fit in with everything you're doing. One who doesn't take center stage, but doesn't get drowned out by the other members: that's the kind of bassist I always wanna be.

Ritsu:
I knowJun & Mio: That's why I'll never touch your bass, Mio. So don't worry about it!

Yui:
Oh! I do declare, I'm kinda jealous, Miss Tainaka.

Ritsu:
Don't be like that.

Mio:
Mmmm…

Other four girls:
Oh!

Mio:
I said way too much!

Yui:
Oh! Hey, Mio-chan! Mio-chan, hello?

Ritsu:
Oh, she's turning into one of the living dead!

Tsumugi:
That is so great! It's just like Mio and her bass are one and the same.

Azusa:
I know what you mean; I love her bass playing.

Tsumugi:
Mhm, so do I.

Yui:
Oh, come on, how long is she gonna stay stiff as a board? Ah, don't worry, Rit-chan. Just leave everything to me! I'm gonna work this all out, you'll see. Snap out of it, Mio! [unintelligible]

Ritsu:
What am I leaving to her?

Ui:
Hm? Sis, what are you doing? That's bad manners, you know.

Yui:
I'm sitting here in a dark corner trying to formulate operation "Shine on, you crazy Rit-chan"!

Ui:
Huh? Well, I'd like to wash the dishes, but… I guess it can wait.

Yui:
…Oh…

Sawako:
[humming]

Photographer:
Ok, here we go!

Sawako:
There's another class after us, so get into position quickly.

Keiko:
All right, how do you want us to line up?

Sawako:
Um, by seat number?

Nobuyo:
Wouldn't it be better if we lined up by height?

Sawako:
Oh, you're right. Thank you for that. This is the very first homeroom class I've ever had, so please, if I make any mistakes, be sure to point them out.

Keiko:
Miss Yamanaka is really great!

Nobuyo:
It's like she's getting prettier and prettier every day!

Sawako:
[giggles]

Mio:
(I like being on the end.)

Tsumugi:
I think I'll stand here. [laughs]

Ristu:
'Scuse me! Could you squeeze over just a little bit?

Mio:
We're lining up by height, remember?

Ritsu:
Watch this!

Tsumugi:
Ah, Rit-chan, you've grown taller!

Mio:
You're sneaky.

Yui:
Look, we're all together!

Mio:
I guess we're not going by height anymore.

Ritsu:
I say we're better off being all together.

Yui:
Me too! It's gonna be a great class picture!

Sawako:
So is everyone in position? All right, whenever you're ready.

Photographer:
Ok, everybody smile! Say cheese!

Yui:
Hey, this is great!

Ritsu:
What are you doing?

Yui:
Heh, Rit-chan, we moved the drum set around, see. You're smack in the middle now!

Ritsu:
Uhh…

Yui:
I was thinking about this idea all night long. You were right about changing things! C'mon, try it out, try it out!

Ritsu:
All right, Yui!

Yui:
Ok, we'll use this position from now on!

Ritsu:
Hmm… I'm embarrassed.

Sawako:
Mmmm… I think this works best.

All five girls:
Yeah, so do I.

Yui:
But don't worry, Rit-chan, you'll still shine!

Ritsu:
Ahh!

Yui:
I'm gonna use this headlamp to light you up!

Ritsu:
Cut it out!

Yui:
Shine on, you crazy Rit-chan!

Ritsu:
Oww-ahh-ohh…

Mio:
Stop it! Yui, look at her! She's gasping for breath!

Yui:
Oopsie…

Yui:
Hey, Rit-chan, you aren't lonely, are you?

Ritsu:
Ehh, why do you ask?

Yui:
Well you're always in the back, so I thought you might get lonely.

Ritsu:
No, not really…

Yui:
What if we try something new. When we're playing, we'll just interact with you more. Kinda like this! [mouth guitar]

Ritsu:
[gasping]

Yui:
Right, now you guys try it. Let's practice how we're gonna interact with Rit-chan who's feeling lonely there in the back.

Azusa:
[sighs]

Yui:
Let's do it! One, two-- [mouth guitar] Hey! [mouth guitar] Hey!

Ritsu:
[gasps]

Yui:
Doesn't that work perfectly?

Mio:
[sighs]

Ritsu:
Yui, you don't understand. That's really not why I'm doing this.

Yui:
Don't go it alone. Rit-chan, if you're hurting, we're all hurting. I won't let you suffer alone!

Ritsu:
Yui! Look, I'm not suffering!

Yui:
Let's get through this together!

Ritsu:
Ahh! Why won't you listen to me!

Yui:
Uh, and I brought all this other stuff, too…

Azusa:
Just give it up, Yui, and take it all back home.

Yui:
Hey, Azu-nyan?

Azusa:
Yes?

Yui:
If Rit-chan doesn't play the drums, I was thinking I might take over.

Azusa:
Huh? Why do you say that?

Yui:
Well, something's really bothering Rit-chan, I know it. It's like she's in a… what's the word I'm looking for? Sounds like gut, not mutt…

Azusa:
Wait, do you mean rut?

Yui:
Yeah, that!

Azusa:
Then you were pretty far off.

Yui:
I think that's why she suddenly wants to try out a bunch of different things.

Azusa:
You really think so?

Yui:
That's why I'm gonna start playing the drums! I'll just sit behind you guys and play the drums.

Azusa:
Maybe not. I think I'd rather you stay where I can see you.

Yui:
Uh, why?

Azusa:
You're reading too much into it, senpai.

Sawako:
[humming] This'll make my skin glow even more!

Ritsu:
[sighs] Huh?! Hmm… thinking about it, I just realized I haven't played my drums for a few days. I was the one who suggested it, but… (I've played the drums every day, ever since I decided I was going to be a drummer.) Mmm. {Let's start a band, Mio! And I'll be the drummer!)

Mio:
(Sounds like fun, but why the drums?)

Ritsu:
(Isn't it awesome how they flail around back there?)

Mio:
Oh!

Ritsu:
(Well, I could only afford drumsticks at first. [gasping in surprise] And later on, I finally got my hands on a used drumkit. And every day since… [sighs] …I still have some callouses. I really wailed away on them at first. [sighs] … [happy sighing])

Satoshi:
Sis, keep it down!

Ritsu and Mio:
[gasping for breath]

Mio:
How could you have overslept?

Ritsu:
I was up late watching a movie!

Mio:
Huh?!

Ritsu:
In a village far from civilization, they have this horrific custom where--

Mio:
[gasps and whimpers]

Ritsu:
I'm kidding! It was a who concert!

Mio:
Huh? What?

Ritsu:
The. Who.

Mio:
Oh, right, you like that band's drummer, don't you, Ritsu?

Ritsu:
Hmm? …Crap! Mio, get a move on!

Sawako:
Please make sure you fill out the self-study activity form for the class trip by tomorrow, ok? There are so many temples that it will seem daunting, but but plan ahead to give yourselves enough time to visit each in turn.

Yui:
Ah! Rit-chan! Mio-chan! I thought you were home sick!

Ristu:
Shh!

Class:
[laughs]

Ritsu:
Heh heh, sorry about that, heh heh-- whoa!

Sawako:
All right, take your seats, please!

Ritsu:
Sawa-chan?

Sawako:
Mm? Mm?

Yui:
What's wrong, Sawa-chan?

Ritsu:
Huh, it's freaky.

Sawako:
I've been trying all sorts of creams to make my skin glow even more.

Ritsu and Yui:
[gasp]

Yui:
Oh my goodness.

Ritsu and Yui:
You overdid it.

Ritsu:
Tada! It's drums or nothing for me!

Mio:
[laughs] Yeah, I figured as much! She told me she watched a Keith Moon DVD yesterday.

Yui:
Who's that?

Mio:
He's a drummer Ritsu really admires.

Azusa:
Oh! He's the guy they called "Moon the Loon" and "Mad Moon", right? I heard he demolished his house with cherry bombs or something.

Ritsu:
Well, that's not what I admire about him. You know, even if I'm in the shadows, and aren't in the spotlight, and you can only see my feet, I still love playing my drums!

Yui:
Yeah! No one but you can be our drummer. When we all look back at you when we're just about to start a song, you count us in with your sticks, and you have a big grin on your face. That always gets me so pumped up! Besides, I also learned some things thanks to you. Even though we're all in the same band, what we see and think are sometimes very different. We all have our own places here, and each of us IS different. But when--

Ritsu:
But when we start playing, we become one!

Yui:
Right!

Ritsu:
You know, as I sit on my stool and watch your backs, I listen to you play, and I bang away on my drums, I love it!

Four other girls:
[chuckle]

Tsumugi:
Oh, I also did something thanks to you! I wrote us a brand new song.

Four other girls:
Huh?

Tsumigi:
And it was all because you made my keyboard speak to me that day.

Mio:
You mean, those noises?

Azusa:
What kind of song is it?

Yui:
I wanna hear it!

Tsumugi:
[humming Honey Sweet Tea Time]

Ritsu:
Yeah, I like it!

Yui:
Hey, I think you should play and sing this one, Mugi-chan!

Tsumugi:
[gasps]

Azusa:
Great idea!

Mio:
Yeah, that might work!

Ritsu:
Mio, get to work on the lyrics.

Tsumugi:
Um, you guys? I also thought of a real good title for the song.

Yui:
What is it, what is it?

Tsumugi:
I call it "honey Sweet Tea Time"!

Ritsu:
Tea again, huh?

Yui:
Wow, these rusks are fantastic when you put honey all over them!

Ritsu:
It's the intermingling of flavors, the combination of tastes!

Azusa:
Um, you've got some stick stuff on the side of your mouth.

Yui:
Hm? Wipe it for me, will ya?

Azusa:
No way. (Here, wipe it yourself!)

Ritsu:
(They're a good team, in their own way.)

Azusa:
Ah, what am I gonna do with you? (You've got it all over!)

Mio:
The honey-colored afternoon passes by, and it's honey sweet tea time.

Tsumugi:
Hey, how would it sound if we repeated that phrase twice?

Mio:
Hmm, that could work.

Ritsu & Yui & Azusa:
[chewing]

Mio:
I can't concentrate!

Tsumugi:
Well, then maybe we should all just take a break!

Mio:
Mhm!

Announcer:
Kyoto, Kyoto!

Yui:
Rit-chan, what's that? It looks like a giant daikon radish! There's one over here, too!

Ritsu:
Haha, that's so goofy!

Yui:
Kitano Tenman-gū…

Ritsu:
Hey, is this place famous or something? Ahh, what view!

Yui:
Wow! All of that is Kyoto?

Ritsu:
Oops.

Mio:
How could this have happened?

Ritsu:
We're lost.

Yui:
Please, just for a while?

Tsumugi:
I have tasty snacks, too!
Part A
Ritsu:
Come on, Yui! Time to practice!

Yui:
Okay, be right there!

Nodokai:
You sure seem excited today.

Yui:
Yeah, the school festival is soon.

Nodokai:
Well, don't get yourself too excited and catch a cold like you did last year.

Yui:
How I won't. I've been eating oranges every day. I ate them so many my hands are yellow!
See you later, Nodoka-chan.

Nodokai:
Stay healthy.

Yui:
Thanks for waiting.

Ritsu:
Now off to the club room.

Sawako:
Yeah, about the club room.

Yui & Mio & Ritsu & Mugi & Azusa:
Huh?

Yui:
Sawa-chan.

Sawako:
It's out of use for a while.

Ritsu:
What is?

Sawako:
The club room.

Yui & Mio & Ritsu & Mugi & Azusa:
Huh?!

OP

Ritsu:
It's true...

Yui:
And we can't have the music room, either...

Sawako:
I wouldn't lie about this.

Ritsu:
Why can't we use it?

Sawako:
Well, you see. There was a report that late at night, an erie dripping sound was heard coming from inside.

Mio:
Oh, I'll be okay. Just please continue.

Sawako:
Well, when they went to investigate the strange sound... They saw there was a water leaking from the ceiling!
That was in the classroom right below the music room. They have to replace all the pipes around there, and since those pipes also passed through the clubroom, it shut down for now, too.

Yui:
Oh...

Ritsu:
Their timing is terrible...

Mugi:
We've got less than a month to get ready for the school festival.

Sawako:
For the time being, I've moved all your instruments out here.
Even the turtle.

Yui:
He's actually a pig-nosed turtle.

Ritsu:
Oh, Azusa.

Azusa:
Hey, is something wrong?
Uh, Ton-chan!

Mugi:
Our room's closed. We can't get in because they're fixing some pipes.

Azusa:
Huh?

Yui:
You realize that means no tea.

Mio:
That's not the main issue here!

Sawako:
According to the schedule, the repairs will take 10 days.

Mio:
Are you saying that we won't be able to practice in there for 10 whole days?

Yui:
So we're just gonna have to find somewhere else to practice.

Sawako:
I'll try to pull some strings and get you into Music Room #2. That's the room that the Wind Instrument Club and the Choir Club use.
In case you've forgotten, I am the advisor to the Wind Instrument Club as well.

Ritsu:
Thank you.

Yui:
It must be bad inside if they close it off completely.

Mugi:
Let's go see for ourselves.

Mio:
I wouldn't do that.

Azusa:
Oh, she's back.

Yui:
How'd it go, Sawa-chan?

Sawako:
Sorry, girls. I struck out...

Ritsu:
You said you had some clout around here.

Sawako:
I know, I'm sorry.

Yui:
So what are we supposed to do now? Where are we gonna practice?

Sawako:
Good question... How about your classroom?

Nobuyo:
Wow! You're gonna practice in here, really?

Yui:
Yeah, we kind of have to...

Azusa:
Sorry, I know it's a bit of an imposition.

Sawako:
Just remember to please keep the level down so you don't disturb the other students.

Yui & Mio & Ritsu & Mugi & Azusa:
Okay.

Sawako:
Good. I'll leave you to it, then.

Yui:
Azu-nyan, this is our classroom so feel free to kick off your shoes and get comfortable.

Azusa:
Easier said than done.

Ritsu:
Good idea!

Mio:
She wasn't talking to you.

Ritsu:
Don't care!
All right! Everybody, ready?

Yui:
Hmph!

Ritsu:
Okay, let's kick it up with "Curry"!

Yui:
Sounds good!

Ritsu:
One. Two. One, two!

Nodokai:
Ah...

Classmates:
Oh.
That was intense!
Guys, you're awesome!

Yui:
Yeah, thanks. But we're not that great.

Girl A:
Um, excuse me.

Yui:
Yeah?

Girl A:
Look, we're right in the middle of discussing our plans for the school festival.

Girl B:
Can you please keep it down?

Mio:
We're so sorry!

Ritsu:
Could you guys hear us?

Yui:
It won't happen again.

Girl B:
Thanks. Sorry to be a bother.

Yui:
What we do?

Ritsu:
Go somewhere else, I guess.

Yui:
Hey, Azu-nyan?

Azusa:
Yes?

Yui:
Don't you think it'd be better for Ton-chan if you left him in our classroom?

Azusa:
Oh, you're probably right.

Yui:
笙ｪ"Rock a bye baby, on the tree top--"

Volleyball club member:
Nice fight!

Yui:
Do you think it'd be okay with you guys if we set up over here?

Ichigo:
Sure. I don't see a problem with that. You might find it a little bit cramped, though.

Yui:
Thanks a bunch.

Ritsu:
Man, I'm spent, Pushing these instruments around all day has worn me out.

Mugi:
I'm feeling great!

Mio:
All right. You ready?

Yui & Azusa:
Yeah!

Azusa:
It seems... like we're a bit of out of place. You guys agree?

Yui:
Yeah, the gym's full of athletic clubs, not musician.

Ritsu:
So, come on. Let's get started!
One. Two. One, two!

Yui:
Um... Hm?

Mio:
Oh! Mm-mm!

Yui:
Mio-chan?

Mio:
Sorry, I couldn't help myself.

Ritsu:
Oh, yeah, I forgot. Mio's a closeted sports nut.

Yui:
Okay, one more time.

Girl:
Let's see some hustle out there!

Azusa:
They sure play with a lot of intensity.

Yui:
Then, we need to play with just as much intensity and passion to match 'em!

Azusa:
Yeah.

Yui:
Like, "The Light Music, hustle!" Let's practice!

Mugi:
Yeah, let's do it. The Light Music, hustle, come on!

Ritsu:
Sweet. Here we go!
One, two, three--

Ichigo:
Stay in sync, people.

Yui:
It's kinda hard to focus in here.

Ritsu:
Drama Club is using the auditorium and the Chinese Poetry Club has the roof.

Sawako:
Which explains why you're back here.

Yui:
Hey, Azu-nyan.

Azusa:
Yes?

Yui:
This is Nodoka-chan's desk, so feel free to sit down if you want.

Azusa:
Oh, thank you.

Yui:
What's the Light Music Club have in common with snakes and ladders?

Mio:
I don't know. What?

Yui:
Because now we are right back to circle one!

Azusa:
You mean [English Dictionary/back#back to square one|square one]]?

Yui:
Oh, yeah, you are right. What you said.

Azusa:
It's important when telling a joke, not to mess up the punch line.

Mugi:
I guess this makes us a {{tooltip|tribe|驛ｨ譌殉} of nomads.

Sawako:
What would you do without me?
All right, I'll keep trying to find a place for you to practice. But it's time to go home now. We'll pick up this conversation tomorrow.

Yui & Mio & Ritsu & Mugi & Azusa:
Okay.

Mugi:
I sure hope Sawa-chan comes through for us tomorrow.

Mio:
Yeah, me too.

Azusa:
You know, we never got to--

Yui:
--eat any snacks at all today.

Azusa:
I knew you were gonna say that!

Yui:
I was just kidding, Azu-nyan.

Ritsu:
Hey, Mio, did you finish making the you-know-what?

Yui:
You mean sweats?

Mio:
No.

Ritsu:
Song lyrics.

Azusa:
You finish writing the new song?

Ritsu:
Sort of. Mugi's music is ready to go, but...

Mio:
I wrote some lyrics for it. But Ritsu didn't seem to like them.

Azusa:
Huh?

Ritsu:
Can you blame me?

Azusa:
"In a forest of candy so sweet, I chat with songbirds. Tweet, tweet,"

Yui:
Oh, nice, sounds tasty!

Mio:
Yeah, well, there's more to it!

Ritsu:
Fine. Let's hear it.

Mio:
It's also got "Paint my love in black and white like a panda", and there's "I wanna dance dance dance like a happy penguin"

Yui:
Wow, so what's up with the animal theme?

Ritsu:
When Mio gets started on animal theme, she just keeps going.

Yui:
Oh.

Mio:
I wanna be evolved like a raccoon dog, Fly into the sunset with me, mandrill--.

Mugi:
Why don't each of us [[[English Dictionary/hand#try (one's) hand (at something)|try our hand at]] writing the lyrics?

Ritsu:
Oh, I like it.

Mio:
You're not gonna use mine at all!?

Ritsu:
Uh, no, we're gonna keep them for backup.
Okay, we'll each write some lyrics and show 'em tomorrow.

Yui:
Roger!

Azusa:
So then, do you want me to write some, too?

Mugi:
Yeah, I can't wait to see what you write.

Yui:
I don't know why, but I'm really excited about this!

Mugi:
Me too!

Yui:
Let the writing begin!
I wonder what I should name it?

Azusa:
We have to come up with the title, too?

Yui:
How about "My Protracted Love for You"?

Ritsu:
Or "School My School Bag"!

Azusa:
Those are just dumb puns. Let's take this seriously, okay?

Sawako:
I tried everywhere I could think of, but I'm sorry. The truth is, there's nowhere the Light Music Club can practice.

Ritsu:
How could you give up so easily?

Sawako:
Hey, I tried really hard to help you out. After the Jazz Club said we couldn't borrow their room, I asked around at the Science Lab, the Food Lab, the conference room, even the principal's office. I wore down my heels walking around all day!

Yui:
You poor thing, I'm sorry.

Mio:
We appreciate you trying.

Ritsu:
I don't know, maybe we should go on practice hiatus until the club room's available again.

Mio:
But that wouldn't give us enough time to get ready for the festival.

Sawako:
Hmm. You could always get a rental studio?

Yui & Mugi:
A rental studio?

Yui:
That's awesome!

Azusa:
We rent those by the hour. Can we really afford that?

Ritsu:
No problem. The club fund is still flush!

Yui:
Oh, Ritchan!

Ritsu:
Huh?

Yui:
I've never wanted your stingy ways more than right now!

Ritsu:
Geez, thanks...


Part B
Yui:
I didn't know there was a rental studio so close to school.

Azusa:
Look. That must be it there.

Yui:
Azu-nyan, Azu-nyan!
Check it out, they sell picks and stickers!

Azusa:
Wow, look at all of them.

Staff:
One of you have to sign for it by filling out your name and address on a form for me.

Ritsu:
You do it, Mio.

Mio:
You are the club president.

Ritsu:
Damn.

Staff:
Since it's your first time here, I'm also gonna need to see some identification.

Ritsu:
Hm. Identification?

Mio:
I'm gonna identify her! She definitely belongs to Sakuragaoka Light Music Club!

Ritsu:
Hm.

Mio:
Your student ID will probably work a little bit better.

Yui:
Ah.

Ritsu:
O-Okay.

Mugi:
There are lots of flyers for people looking for band members.

Yui:
There sure are. Maybe we should put a flyer looking for new band members, too!

Mugi:
That's a great idea!

Ritsu:
That seems really fascinating and all, but--

Mio:
Let's go.

Yui:
Let's see what we got.
Oh! Wow, this is cool!
A little smaller than I was expecting.

Mio & Ritsu:
Don't be so picky!

Yui:
Oh?
Is this a mirror? Do we really have a mirror? It is a mirror!
Um, do I look kind of dorky caring Gita on my back like this?

Ritsu:
Yeah, a little bit.

Mio:
You're just now noticing?

Yui:
Hmm, I never realized this.

Yui & Ritsu:
Hm.

Yui:
It's hard not to primp when there's a big mirror around, huh.

Ritsu:
We are girls, right?

Azusa:
What's so great about this is we can check ourselves out while we're playing.

Mio:
Mm.

Mugi:
The tea's ready now.

Ritsu:
Oh, yeah.

Mio:
So that's why you were looking for an outlet.

Mugi:
Mm-hmm.

Staff:
Excuse me. Sorry but we don't allow food or drinks in the studio.

Azusa:
Oh, sorry, of course. We understand.

Yui:
Sorry.
That's weird. It's like he could see in the room somehow.

Mio:
Because he can.

Yui:
Wow, you're right! Yah-hah.

Mugi:
What should I do with these?

Ritsu:
Well, since they're made and all, let's drink them outside.

Yui:
Now it feels like home.

Mio:
Hey, look! We're not paying for the studio so you can feel at home.

Yui:
Relax, just one cup of tea and we'll get to practicing, okay?

Ritsu:
Hey, I've got an idea in the meantime. Let's show the lyrics we wrote last night.
Alright then, who wants to show their stuff first?

Yui:
Oh!

Azusa:
Wow. I don't believe it. Did you actually write some lyrics?

Yui:
They're good, too.

Mio & Ritsu & Mugi & Azusa:
Huh?

Yui:
"Rice is really amazing. It goes with anything."

Ritsu:
Uh...

Yui:
"Ramen, udon, okonomiyaki. It's like a happy marriage of carbohydrates and teriyaki. And I--"

Ritsu:
Okay, thank you. We've heard enough.

Yui:
But my lyrics for the chorus are even better!
"One, two, three, four! Rice!"
And wait till you hear the title. It's "Rice is a Side Dish"!

Ritsu:
Mugi, your turn.

Yui:
Huh?

Mugi:
Listen to this, Yui-chan.
"The icy wind is like a knife piercing her skin."

Ritsu:
Uh?

Mugi:
"Yoshie has the culprit cornered at the edge of a precipice."

Ritsu:
Eh...

Mugi:
"Kenichi, it's true. We all know it! The real villain is you!"

Ritsu:
And denied!

Mugi:
Whoa?

Mio:
Mugi, those are lyrics?

Mugi:
Mm-hmm. I thought it'd be nice to try something off the beaten path.

Ritsu:
Not that far off the path! Your turn, Azusa.

Azusa:
Okay.
Uh, um, do I really have to read them out loud? I don't know how good they are.

Yui:
Go on! Read 'em, read 'em!

Azusa:
"I can feel your gaze upon me, trembling, trembling like jelly."

Mugi:
Aha. Well, I like it.

Azusa:
"Look this way. No, don't look."

Ritsu:
Yeah, go on, go on!

Azusa:
"I'm here. I'll give you what you want,"

Yui & Ritsu:
Oh!

Azusa:
"So just give me a minute, Ton-chan."

Yui:
It's a song about feeding a turtle?

Ritsu:
Rewrite it.

Azusa:
So it's that bad?

Mio:
Okay, Ritsu, let's hear what you wrote.
"Simon, Roe, Roe, Roe, Your Boat"? "Phone the phone"? "The cat catnapped"?

Ritsu:
Okay, I admit it, they're more lame than funny.

Mio:
They aren't even lyrics!

Mugi:
Did you write something, Mio-chan?

Mio:
I wrote two, "The Raccoon Stole My Heart" and "The Giraffe Wants to Neck".

Yui:
She's still in a rut.

Mio:
Wait! How much time have we wasted here?

Azusa:
All right. Let's start practicing.

Yui:
Huh? Why is that light flashing?

Ritsu:
Wow, maybe it's stage lighting. A free service!

Yui:
Do we dance?

Ritsu:
So that light meant our time was up.

Yui:
It's all Mugi-chan's fault for making tea.

Mugi:
But you are the one who kept asking for more...

Azusa:
I guess renting studio time was kind of a big waste, huh.

Yui:
I wonder what our club room looks like right now.

Azusa:
Huh?

Yui:
When something is always there, you stop realizing how much it means to you.

Ritsu:
Sawa-chan!

Yui:
Hey, there!

Mugi:
Hi!

Sawako:
Hey, the repairs in the club room are done now!

Yui & Mio & Ritsu & Mugi & Azusa:
Huh?

Sawako:
They finished way ahead of schedule.

Mugi:
Thank goodness!

Yui:
Finally, we get to have our club room back!

Ritsu:
And the saga ends.

Sawako:
Easy on the drama.
Load your instruments in the car. I'll take them to school for you tomorrow.

Ritsu:
Perfect! You can give us a ride home, too, then.

Yui:
Ride, please!

Sawako:
I told you before! I can't fit five people in here.

Yui:
Meany!

Yui:
We're home!
After so much struggle... We're home at last!

Ritsu:
It's good to be back.

Azusa:
I really like it here.

Yui:
I never knew how lucky we were to have this practice room.

Mio:
The past few days have made that clear.

Yui:
Hm-hm.

Mugi:
We don't have to wander all over the place anymore.

Yui:
Not at all! We can just come here every day!

Ritsu:
So let's play!

Mugi:
Shall I make some tea?

Yui:
Eh...
Maybe we should play a song first!

Ritsu & Mugi:
Yeah!

Mio & Azusa:
Yeah.

Yui:
All that's left now is those lyrics.

Ui:
Hey, big sis. I peeled a nice pear for you!
What are you doing?

Yui:
Everybody in the Light Music Club is supposed to write one set of lyrics.

Ui:
So now you're writing as well? That's so awesome.
Mind if I take a look?

Yui:
Go ahead.

Ui:
"Rice Is a Side Dish"?

Yui:
I thought my lyrics were actually kind of good. But the reaction from the reaction from the others was lukewarm.
What do you think, Ui?

Ui:
I think you've written something completely original and different.

Yui:
I know, right?
I love Asian pears.
All right! I'm gonna pull an all-nighter on these lyrics!

Ui:
Uh... Are you sure? Don't push yourself too hard, big sis.

Yui:
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.

Ui:
Hey, sis, do you want me to help you with this?

Yui:
Really? That'll be awesome, Ui!

Ritsu:
Yeah, I've got nothin'.

Azusa:
I guess trying to write good lyrics is harder than it looks.

Mio:
Yui, you're looking confident.

Yui:
Mm-hmm. I finished three already.

Ritsu:
Sure you did.

Yui:
Here.

Ritsu:
Eh?

Azusa:
These are amazing. They rhyme and everything.

Ritsu:
You really wrote these all yourself, Yui?

Yui:
Well, I may've had a teensy-weensy bit of help from Ui.

Ritsu:
And by "teensy-weensy"--

Azusa:
She means--

Mio:
A lot.

Mugi:
You're about to fall asleep, Yui-chan.

Yui:
I got so wrapped up in the lyrics. I didn't get much sleep.

Mio:
Okay, but just don't catch a cold like you did last year.

Yui:
Have no fear. I've got Mighty Mikans on my side!
Let me give you some mikan power!
Mikan!

Mio:
Hm? Uh.
Hello, Mio speaking.

Yui:
Mio-chan...

Mio:
What's wrong, Yui?

Yui:
Caught a cold...

Mio:
Whoa! What?!

Mio & Ritsu & Mugi & Azusa:
Huh?

Mio:
It's Ui who has a cold?

Ritsu:
You freaked us out over nothing?! Not that Ui getting sick is nothing but...

Yui:
What am I supposed to do?

Mio:
Keep it together, Yui! All right, where's Ui?

Mio & Ritsu & Mugi & Azusa:
Huh?

Ui:
Hey, there, everyone. Would you... like some tea?

Mio & Ritsu & Mugi & Azusa:
Whoa!

Azusa:
Now just relax and stay in bed.

Ui:
I'm sorry, Azusa-chan.

Mugi:
It's okay, Her fever is actually pretty low.

Ritsu:
Well, that's good.
Okay, Yui. Guess we should be heading home now.

Yui:
Huh?! You're leaving?

Ritsu:
Ui needs to rest, and she can't do that if we're hanging around, right?

Yui:
But I'm not sure I can take care of her by myself...

Ui:
It's okay, sis. I can help you out if you need it.

Azusa:
Ui, you're the one who needs to be helped right now!

Yui:
It's all right, Ui. Don't worry I got this!

Mugi:
If you need anything at any hour, just call.

Mio:
We'll be here before you know it.

Ui:
Look, sis. You don't have to stay here all night. I'll be fine by myself.

Yui:
Yeah, but...

Ui:
Listen, if you stay here, I'll just be worried the whole time that you'll end up catching my cold.

Yui:
Ui...

Ui:
Go back to your room.

Yui:
Mm-hm.
Okay, but if you need anything, just say something.

Ui:
Sure.

Yui:
I know, I'll make some {{tooltip|rice porridge|縺翫°繧��}.
Why do eggs break so easily?

Ui:
Uh, I'm too worried to sleep, but if I don't sleep, I'll never get better.

Yui:
Precious, priceless things. They're always there at my side, but as soon as I take them for granted, to their value I become blind.

Ui:
I feel a lot better.
Uh?
She put a fried egg on top of rice porridge?
Uh?
"U & I"?
"If you're not here, I can't do anything. Why? I want to eat the food you make. If you're not here, then I can't even apologize. I want you here to hear your voice."

Ritsu:
And without further ado, the votes are in, the lyric writing winner is Yui!

Yui:
Oh, gosh, thanks.

Mugi:
They're so good, Yui-chan. I was really touched by them.

Yui:
You know how you don't really know what you got till it's gone, and then you're like "I need that". That's the feeling I was trying to go for.

Azusa:
I don't believe it, Yui-senpai. You really wrote these lyrics?

Ritsu:
I'm guessing Ui-chan and the club room were your inspiration.

Yui:
Yeah, looks like my hidden talents have finally blossomed.

Ritsu:
If you say so.

Mio:
What about mine?

Ritsu:
You know, one song's really not enough for us! Hey, let's write two songs. No, why stop at two! Let's do three, or even four!

ED

Preview
Ritsu:
Miss Akiyama.

Mio:
Oh, yeah, I just remembered. I'm transferring to a different school.

Ritsu & Azusa:
Uh...

Mio:
You see, my papa's moving the whole family to Irkutsk because of his job.

Nodokai:
I see. Well, if you're that dead set against it, I maybe consider.

Mio:
Really?

Ritsu:
Way to rock it, Mio. Hm?
We're going.

Mio:
N-No. I don't wanna--I don't wanna!
I'm done...
